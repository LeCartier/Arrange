SECTION I – GENERAL 
 
A. USE OF THE PROGRAM GUIDE 
 
1. The requirements in this Program Guide apply to new construction projects and to renovation projects where the existing finishes and 
door openings are not suitable for the intended use of the space involved.  The Door, Hardware, and Finish Schedules are intended as 
VA Standards that are intended to be followed for the selection of finishes, doors, and hardware. The Architect, Interior Designer, 
and Hardware Consultant shall consult and review the requirements with the facility to understand the functions of the rooms for 
that particular project and adjust finishes, doors, and hardware accordingly. Security systems standards at various facilities may 
require selection of different devices such as push button locks, card readers, or proximity readers as an example.  Refer to 
Standard Details PG-18-4 for additional requirements.  
 
2. Doors and hardware requirements are indicated by their respective door symbols and hardware set numbers in Section III of this Program 
Guide. Additional requirements are shown in Section II, "Doors and Hardware". For door frame requirements refer to Standard Details PG 
18-4.  
 
3. Room Codes are from VA Space Planning Criteria (PG 18-9). Reference VA National BIM Standards for guidance.  
 
4. Finishes are scheduled in Section III for the floor, base, wainscot, wall, and ceiling surfaces for each room or space. See list of finish 
abbreviations in paragraph (b) below. 
a. Where a combination of materials are separated by the symbol "/" i.e. GWB/CMU, AT/(GWB), etc., the designer shall select the 
appropriate materials from those listed on the basis of project requirements and cost and shall detail and specify only the selected 
materials in the construction documents. The "/" indicates the option of materials listed. Where a combination of materials separated 
by the symbol "-" i.e. GWB-W, etc. indicates an additional material finish or modification. 
b. The following abbreviations are used for material and finish codes throughout this Guide. The A/E shall coordinate any additional 
abbreviations, per project requirements, and the construction documents.

jurisdictions having lawful authority over the work. 
 
B. DOOR HARDWARE: 
 
1. HARDWARE RESPONSIBILITY: It is recommended that the selection of hardware and the preparation of Builder's (Finish) Hardware 
Specification be performed by an independent Hardware Consultant (not a manufacturer’s representative, manufacturer, distributor, or 
sales agency) with a minimum five (5) years' experience specifying door hardware for medical/institutional projects. The Hardware 
Consultant shall prepare specifications for Section 08 17 10, “Integrated Door Assemblies” and Section 08 71 13, “Automatic Door 
Operators.” The Hardware Consultant shall also review the following sections for coordination with the Door Hardware specification: 
Section 08 11 13, “Hollow Metal Doors and Frames;” Section 08 14 00, “Interior Wood Doors;” Section 08 41 13, “Aluminum-Framed 
Entrances and Storefronts;” Section 08 34 53, “Security Doors and Frames,” and Section 32 31 13,  “Chain Link Fences and Gates,” based 
upon the VA Technical Information Library (TIL) Master Construction Specifications PG 18-1. Hardware types not listed in the TIL Master 
Construction Specifications, e.g. Section 08 42 23, “Sound Control Door Assemblies;” Section 08 42 29, Automatic Entrances;” and Section 
32 31 19, “Decorative Metal Fences and Gates,” shall be specified on a per project basis, using the section designations as listed in the 
Construction Specifications Institute’s Master Format 2004, and formatted consistent with the TIL VA Master Construction Specifications. 
The Hardware Consultant shall co-ordinate with Architect for these sections. 
 
2. HARDWARE SETS: 
a. General:  Hardware  standards  for  door  openings  from  Corridors  to  rooms  and  spaces  is  listed  under  column  headings 
"HARDWARE - H.W. NO." in this Program Guide, except as otherwise shown below. These hardware sets correspond to sets of hardware 
listed in specification Section 08 71 00, "Door Hardware."  Hardware Consultant is responsible for selecting, modifying, or developing 
appropriate hardware sets for each door opening.  Hardware Consultant shall consider the following when selecting appropriate 
hardware: 
1) Doors in Smoke and Fire Partitions: The hardware sets listed under the column heading "HARDWARE - H.W. NO." are indicated for 
both rated and non-rated doors.  
In cases where a smoke barrier or fire door must remain open under normal conditions (fail safe), select a hardware set that has a 
magnetic hold-open or, where wall conditions will not allow, a combination closer-holder instead of a closer only. Magnetic holdopens
and closer-holders must be connected to the fire alarm system. 
2) Lead Lined Doors: Coordinate the hardware sets with the lead lined door and frame details shown on the Standard Detail 
drawings and the project drawings. Refer to Standard Details PG 18-4 Lead Lined Door Detail #SD081113-03, Architectural. 
Program Guide PG 18-14 
Room Finishes, Door, & Hardware Schedule  April 10, 2017

3) Chapel Doors: For Corridor entrance doors to Nave, provide a special Chapel hardware set which reflects a spiritual but nondenominational
theme. 
4)  Existing Doors or Frames to remain in place: Select and coordinate hardware requirements for these conditions to ensure that 
suitable and compatible hardware is provided for intended use of space.  Door hardware subcontractor shall be required to field 
verify compatibility of  specified hardware with existing conditions (door and frame type, swing, existing hardware preps) prior to 
submitting hardware schedule for Architect review, and shall advise of any conflicts and propose solutions in such cases. 
5) Corridor Doors: Cross-corridor doors to Mental Health Units and other Special Care Units may require electric locks to control free 
movement of patients. Such locks shall meet the requirements of NFPA-101 as well as allow staff movement in and out of Nursing 
Unit. 
6) Panic Doors Serving Non-Ambulatory Patients: Exit doors with panic hardware that serve as a  required means of egress for nonambulatory
patients shall utilize Integrated Door Assemblies with recessed panic hardware and, where possible, swing-clear 
hinges to provide maximum clearance for gurney traffic. 
7) Automatic Swing  Door  Operators:  The  Hardware  Consultant  shall  select  or  develop  hardware  sets  to  meet  operational 
requirements of automatic swing door operators where they occur.  Provide for concealed wiring of door-mounted sensors (no 
armored door loops).  Provide for electric unlatching of automatic fire doors without compromising physical security 
requirements (fail secure); such electric unlatching shall be disabled in a fire alarm condition. 
8) Security Requirements: Hardware Consultant shall obtain detailed security requirements, security plans, and security door 
elevations from Architect’s Security Consultant.  Coordinate power for electric door hardware items.  Coordinate provision of 
alarm contacts (by Door Hardware or Security Section) and indicate in the hardware sets so that doors and frames may be properly 
factory-prepared. Hardware Consultant shall provide a Theory of Operation (narrative) for each Security Hardware (SH-Series) set.
