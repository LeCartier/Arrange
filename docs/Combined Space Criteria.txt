1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines Space Planning Criteria for Chapter 100: Medical and Surgical 
Patient Care Units (MSPCU). It applies to all medical facilities in Veterans Affairs (VA). 
Services which are accommodated in the units listed above include, but are not limited to, 
those focused on Cardiac, Cardiac Step Down, Neurological, and Orthopedic patients. 
Refer to the following chapters for additional programming data: 
Chapter 102 – Intensive Care Patient Care Units (ICPCUs) 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Inpatient Care Unit: A dedicated unit for inpatient accommodations, providing direct health 
care, support services, and institutional services. The minimum number of beds, of all types, 
to generate one Inpatient Unit is seventeen (17), and the maximum number of beds 
allowed on one Inpatient Unit is thirty-three (33). 
Medical Patient Care Unit: This unit provides for the care of patients with medical (non- 
surgical) disease or illness. 
Neurological Patient Care Unit: This unit provides for the care of patients whose primary 
treatment is for the injury or dysfunction of the brain, spinal cord, and/or nervous system. 
Orthopedic Patient Care Unit: This unit provides for care to the surgical and/or medical 
orthopedic patients, allowing consolidation of all specialized orthopedic equipment (beds, 
frames, crutches, etc.) on one unit. 
Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS): The digital capture, transfer, and 
storage of diagnostic images. A PACS system consists of workstations for interpretation, 
image/data producing modalities, a web server for distribution, printers for file records, 
image servers for information transfer and holding, and an archive of off-line information. A 
computer network is needed to support digital imaging devices. 
Provider: An individual who examines, diagnoses, treats, prescribes medication, and 
manages the care of patients within his or her scope of practice as established by the 
governing body of a healthcare organization. 
Step Down Patient: A general medical, surgical, or coronary care unit can provide care to 
those patients discharged from an intensive care unit who require more care than that 
provided on a general Inpatient Care unit. Step Down patients require telemetry 
monitoring. 
Surgical Patient Care Unit: This unit provides for the care of patients whose primary 
treatment was an invasive procedure. 
Telemetry Unit: See Step-Down Patient Care Unit. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Accessible: A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with provisions outlined 
in the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA). 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
100 – Medical / Surgical Patient Care Unit (MS-PCU) 
3 of 20 
Architectural Barriers Act (ABA): A set of standards developed to ensure that all buildings 
financed with federal funds are designed and constructed to be fully accessible to everyone. 
This law requires all construction, renovation, or leasing of sites, facilities, buildings, and 
other elements, financed with federal funds, to comply with the Architectural Barriers Act 
Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). The ABAAS replaces the Uniform Federal Accessibility 
Standards (UFAS). 
Average Length of Encounter (ALoE): Averaged length of time, in minutes, a patient spends 
in an Exam / Treatment Room interacting with a provider and the clinical support team. It is 
accounted from room “set-up” to “clean-up” by staff. This metric is used to determine the 
number of annual patient / provider encounters that take place in an Exam / Treatment 
Room which, in turn, is used to calculate the number of Exam / Treatment Rooms needed in 
a facility based on projected annual workload. The ALoE is determined with VHA SME input 
during a PG-18-9 clinical chapter revision / update. 
Average Length of Stay (ALoS): The average number of days a patient Veteran stays in an 
inpatient care unit. The ALoS is used to calculate the number of patient bedrooms for a 
specialty by dividing the site’s projected workload by the ALoS. 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Clinic Stop: Per these criteria, a clinic stop is the workload unit of measure for space 
planning. Clinic Stops are codified by VSSC, when applicable, they are referenced by number 
in the calculation of workload driven patient care spaces in this document. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Encounter: An interaction between a patient Veteran and a VA provider or providers in an 
Exam Room / Treatment Room / Consultation Room / Procedure Room, spaces where a 
patient Veteran received clinical care. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
100 – Medical / Surgical Patient Care Unit (MS-PCU) 
4 of 20 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Patient Unique: (or Unique Patient), A Veteran patient counted as a unique in each division 
from which they receive care. Patient Uniques are included in the Registry for a VA Medical 
Center. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022

5 of 20 
Provider: An individual who examines, diagnoses, treats, prescribes medication, and 
manages the care of patients within his or her scope of practice as established by the 
governing body of a healthcare organization. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
Room Efficiency Factor: A factor that provides flexibility in the utilization of a room to 
account for patient delays, scheduling conflicts, and equipment maintenance. Common 
factors are in the 75% to 85% range. A room with 80% room efficiency provides a buffer to 
assume that this room would be available 20% of the time beyond the planned operational 
practices for this room. This factor may be adjusted based on the actual and/or anticipated 
operations and processes of the room/department at a particular facility. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
Stop Code: A measure of workload including clinic stops forecasted by the Office of Policy 
and Planning (OPP) for all Strategic Planning Categories at Medical Center and Outpatient 
Clinic levels. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022

6 of 20 
Telehealth: The use of technology, such as computers and mobile devices, to manage 
healthcare remotely. It includes a variety of health care services, including but not limited to 
online support groups, online health information and self-management tools, email and 
online communication with health care providers, remote monitoring of vital signs, video, 
or online doctor visits. Depending on the concept of operations for this space, it may be 
equipped as an exam room or as a consult room with video/camera capability. 
Utilization Rate: A factor used in the calculation of a directly workload-driven room 
throughput. It represents, in a percent value, the room is idle based on the planning 
assumptions. For example, if a directly workload-driven room is available for use 8 hours a 
day, the Utilization Rate represents the assumed time it will be used, an 85% utilization rate 
indicates, for planning purposes, the room will be used 6.8 hours a day. An additional 
directly workload-driven room will be provided in the calculation once the previous room 
has reached 100% utilization. The utilization Rate is embedded in the Room Throughput 
value calculated in Section 3 of this document. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
Workstation: Area outfitted with equipment and furnishings, typically allocated 56 NSF 
each. Managers and other staff with no direct reports as well as part-time, seasonal, and 
job-sharing staff may qualify for a workstation. Such environments are particularly 
conducive to team-oriented office groupings. These environments work best when they 
have access to conference and small group meeting spaces. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space planning criteria included in this Standard have been specifically developed for 
this Department / Service in a Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare facility based 
on established VHA policy and guidelines to define the scope of services provided for 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
100 – Medical / Surgical Patient Care Unit (MS-PCU) 
7 of 20 
the veterans existing workload demand as well as that in the foreseeable future. Rooms 
and Functional Areas are provided based on research of clinical and non-clinical 
activities performed in this Department. 
B. Development / update of VA’s Program Guide (PG) standards is a research based effort 
executed with participation of VHA Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), VA-Construction and 
Facilities Management Office (CFM) professional staff and specialty consultants hired for 
the task. These space planning standards are based on current applicable VHA policies 
and guidelines, established and/or anticipated best practice standards, and latest 
medical technology developments. Workload metrics were tailored to satisfy current 
and anticipated veteran workload demand. 
C. The space planning component of PG-18-9 is based on the Space Planning Concept 
Matrix (SPCM) which lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and assigns room 
quantity (Q) and area (NSF) for a series of ranges corresponding to the smallest to the 
largest department for this service in the VA healthcare system in incremental sizes; 
each range corresponds to a workload parameter which determines the number and 
area of each directly workload-driven room. The remainder of the rooms in the range 
i.e., waiting, storage, staff workstations, etc. are determined by ratios to the resulting 
number of or NSF of the workload-driven rooms. 
D. Sections 4 and 5 of these space planning standards as well as the PG-18-5 standard are 
implemented in the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) and hosted at the 
MAX.gov website so planners working on VA Construction projects can develop single or 
multi-department projects based on these -PG-18-9- and the PG-18-5 standards. Output 
from SEPS is through Space and Contents Reports; the Space Report is the Program for 
Design (PFD), the Content Report is the Project Room Contents (PRC). Inclusion of a 
Functional Area as well as Room quantity (Q) and determination of the room area (NSF) 
in the PFD is based on the projected Workload input which triggers calculations included 
in the Room Criteria Statements (RCSs). The RCSs are placed immediately after each 
room name, room code and baseline area (NSF). The PRC list the medical equipment, 
furniture and fixtures associated to each Room Code in the project. The PFD & PRC are 
the baseline requirements for the planning phase of a VA project based on a site’s 
projected workload for the target planning year. This chapter’s corresponding PG-18-12, 
Design Guide -if available- is intended for use during the design phase of the project. 
E. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Medical & 
Surgical Patient Care Units (MS PCUs) Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed 
as the basis for this chapter. The MS PCUs SPCM lists all the spaces a VA MS PCUs site 
would require; the quantity and NSF for each room is calculated based on the MS PCUs 
projected workload or number of FTE positions authorized. The SPCM is organized in 8 
ranges, each range represents an incremental workload value of 32 patient rooms, this 
way all current VA MS PCUs sites are covered, the upper ranges are calculated for future 
facilities in case a higher projected workload or FTE positions authorized than those at 
the present time for MS PCUs. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
100 – Medical / Surgical Patient Care Unit (MS-PCU) 
8 of 20 
F. The SPCM metrics are translated into one (or more) Room Criteria Statement (RCS) for 
each room in Section 5 of this document. The SPCM Planning Range, the maximum 
number of directly workload-driven patient bedroom, in this document is 267. If a 
project shall require provision of workload driven rooms above the maximum range 
value) refer to CFM for guidance. Rooms in this space planning document are organized 
in 8 Functional Areas (FAs). 
G. Based on its intended function, each room / space is assigned a: 
1. Room Name (RN), 
2. Room Code (RC), 
3. Room Area, the Net Square Feet (NSF) and its corresponding “soft metric” Net 
Square Meters (NSM), 
4. Unique Room Criteria Statement(s) (RCSs) correlated to answers to Input Data 
Statements (IDSs), and 
5. Room Comment as needed. 
H. The Room Codes included in this chapter stem from the VA Room Family. A unique 
support space, that may have variable area, is assigned a unique Room Code and adopts 
the square footage, as needed, correlated to the room contents assigned which in turn 
correspond to the range for those rooms. A unique clinical space or a direct clinical 
support room, i.e., control room, system components room, etc. typically does not 
feature variable NSF. Patient Care room names for rooms unique to this chapter end in 
“, MS PCU”. Patient Care Support room names end in “, Bldg Sprt”, “Clncl Sprt”, “Stff 
Sprt”, or “, Vet Sprt”, correlating to Building, Clinical, Staff or Veteran Support room 
families. 
I. Section 5, Sub-Section I lists the SEPS Importer Shortcuts used for implementation of 
Sections 4 & 5 in SEPS. These shortcuts are inserted into the Room Criteria Statement 
(RCS) for each room which upon upload into the Space and Equipment Planning System 
(SEPS) allowing planners developing VA healthcare projects to determine quantity and 
square footage of each room by performing mathematical or logical calculations. 
Shortcuts refer to Input Data Statements (IDSs), Rooms, or calculation parameters 
stemming from the SPCM. 
J. SEPS is accessible to government healthcare planners and private sector consultants 
working on VA HC projects during their Period of Performance (PoP) through the 
MAX.gov website. 
K. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross factor (NTDG) factor of 1.65 for Medical 
& Surgical Patient Care Units (PCUs) and a Building Gross factor of 1.35 in the space 
calculation to generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building 
Gross Square Feet (BGSF) respectively for the project based on the aggregate resulting 
Net Square Feet (NSF) for each range. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the 
NTDG factor is fixed. 
L. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-5 Equipment Guidelist for the Room Content 
assignment for each room during the planning phase of a project.

I. SEPS IMPORTER SHORTCUTS 
The following shortcuts are used in the Room Criteria Statements in the Medical & 
Surgical Patient Care Units Functional Areas. These shortcuts are used during upload of 
this document into the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) software during 
implementation of the space planning parameters contained herewith to allow for 
mathematical or logical calculations to be performed. Input Data Statements (IDSs), 
Rooms or a partial calculation formula can have a shortcut. 
1. Acute Inpatient Medical / Surgical patient beds projected: [How many Acute 
Inpatient Medical / Surgical patient beds are projected?] 
6 PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. Separation of patient, visitor, and support traffic should be considered to the greatest 
extent possible and should be considered in the placement of the bed tower and in 
connections to ancillary services. 
B. Standardization of Bedrooms and modular design should be considered to allow 
flexibility to adapt to new technologies and respond to changes in patient volumes. 
C. Design should accommodate patient privacy and confidentiality in all areas, and in 
reception and patient care areas. This includes visual and auditory considerations. 
D. Where possible, the department should be configured to limit the mix of patient and 
service functions, and to maintain clear separation of clean and dirty functions to avoid 
cross contamination.

1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines Space Planning Criteria for Chapter 102: Intensive Care Patient 
Units. It applies to all medical facilities in Veterans Affairs (VA). 
An Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is specially equipped with trained personnel and facility 
inpatient accommodations to care for patients too acutely ill to be placed in a conventional 
Medical / Surgical Patient Care Unit (i.e., unstable vital signs, arrhythmias, fluid and 
electrolyte imbalance, and respiratory failure). 
Intensive Care Patient Units can be classified as follows: 
A. General Intensive Care Patient Unit 
B. Medical Intensive Care Patient Unit 
C. Surgical Intensive Care Patient Unit 
D. Coronary Intensive Care Patient Unit 
Refer to the following chapters for additional programming data: 
A. Chapter 274 – Quarters, On Call 
B. Chapter 100 – Medical / Surgical Patient Care Units 
2 DEFINITIONS 
CICU: An acronym for Coronary Intensive Care Unit 
Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS): The digital capture, transfer, and 
storage of diagnostic images. A PACS system consists of: workstations for interpretation, 
image/data producing modalities, a web server for distribution, printers for file records, 
image servers for information transfer and holding, and an archive of off-line information. A 
computer network is needed to support digital imaging devices. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Accessible: A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with provisions outlined 
in the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA). 
Architectural Barriers Act (ABA): A set of standards developed to ensure that all buildings 
financed with federal funds are designed and constructed to be fully accessible to everyone. 
This law requires all construction, renovation, or leasing of sites, facilities, buildings, and 
other elements, financed with federal funds, to comply with the Architectural Barriers Act 
Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). The ABAAS replaces the Uniform Federal Accessibility 
Standards (UFAS). 
Average Length of Encounter (ALoE): Averaged length of time, in minutes, a patient spends 
in an Exam / Treatment Room interacting with a provider and the clinical support team. It is 
accounted from room “set-up” to “clean-up” by staff. This metric is used to determine the 
number of annual patient / provider encounters that take place in an Exam / Treatment 
Room which, in turn, is used to calculate the number of Exam / Treatment Rooms needed in 
a facility based on projected annual workload. The ALoE is determined with VHA SME input 
during a PG-18-9 clinical chapter revision / update. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022

Average Length of Stay (ALoS): The average number of days a patient Veteran stays in an 
inpatient care unit. The ALoS is used to calculate the number of patient bedrooms for a 
specialty by dividing the site’s projected workload by the ALoS. 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS.

Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Patient Unique: (or Unique Patient), A Veteran patient counted as a unique in each division 
from which they receive care. Patient Uniques are included in the Registry for a VA Medical 
Center. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Provider: An individual who examines, diagnoses, treats, prescribes medication, and 
manages the care of patients within his or her scope of practice as established by the 
governing body of a healthcare organization. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects.

/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
102 – Intensive Care Patient Care Unit (IC PCU) 
5 of 17 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
Room Efficiency Factor: A factor that provides flexibility in the utilization of a room to 
account for patient delays, scheduling conflicts, and equipment maintenance. Common 
factors are in the 75% to 85% range. A room with 80% room efficiency provides a buffer to 
assume that this room would be available 20% of the time beyond the planned operational 
practices for this room. This factor may be adjusted based on the actual and/or anticipated 
operations and processes of the room/department at a particular facility. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
Stop Code: A measure of workload including clinic stops forecasted by the Office of Policy 
and Planning (OPP) for all Strategic Planning Categories at Medical Center and Outpatient 
Clinic levels. 
Telehealth: The use of technology, such as computers and mobile devices, to manage 
healthcare remotely. It includes a variety of health care services, including but not limited to 
online support groups, online health information and self-management tools, email and 
online communication with health care providers, remote monitoring of vital signs, video, 
or online doctor visits. Depending on the concept of operations for this space, it may be 
equipped as an exam room or as a consult room with video/camera capability. 
Utilization Rate: A factor used in the calculation of a directly workload-driven room 
throughput. It represents, in a percent value, the room is idle based on the planning 
assumptions. For example, if a directly workload-driven room is available for use 8 hours a 
day, the Utilization Rate represents the assumed time it will be actually be used, an 85% 
utilization rate indicates, for planning purposes, the room will be used 6.8 hours a day. An 
additional directly workload-driven room will be provided in the calculation once the 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
102 – Intensive Care Patient Care Unit (IC PCU) 
6 of 17 
previous room has reached 100% utilization. The utilization Rate is embedded in the Room 
Throughput value calculated in Section 3 of this document. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
Workstation: Area outfitted with equipment and furnishings, typically allocated 56 NSF 
each. Managers and other staff with no direct reports as well as part-time, seasonal, and 
job-sharing staff may qualify for a workstation. Such environments are particularly 
conducive to team-oriented office groupings. These environments work best when they 
have access to conference and small group meeting spaces. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space planning criteria included in this Standard have been specifically developed for 
this Department / Service in a Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare facility based 
on established VHA policy and guidelines to define the scope of services provided for 
the veterans existing workload demand as well as that in the foreseeable future. Rooms 
and Functional Areas are provided based on research of clinical and non-clinical 
activities performed in this Department. 
B. Development / update of VA’s Program Guide (PG) standards is a research based effort 
executed with participation of VHA Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), VA-Construction and 
Facilities Management Office (CFM) professional staff and specialty consultants hired for 
the task. These space planning standards are based on current applicable VHA policies 
and guidelines, established and/or anticipated best practice standards, and latest 
medical technology developments. Workload metrics were tailored to satisfy current 
and anticipated veteran workload demand. 
C. The space planning component of PG-18-9 is based on the Space Planning Concept 
Matrix (SPCM) which lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and assigns room 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
102 – Intensive Care Patient Care Unit (IC PCU) 
7 of 17 
quantity (Q) and area (NSF) for a series of ranges corresponding to the smallest to the 
largest department for this service in the VA healthcare system in incremental sizes; 
each range corresponds to a workload parameter which determines the number and 
area of each directly workload-driven room. The remainder of the rooms in the range 
i.e., waiting, storage, staff workstations, etc. are determined by ratios to the resulting 
number of or NSF of the workload-driven rooms. 
D. Sections 4 and 5 of these space planning standards as well as the PG-18-5 standard are 
implemented in the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) and hosted at the 
MAX.gov website so planners working on VA Construction projects can develop single or 
multi-department projects based on these -PG-18-9- and the PG-18-5 standards. Output 
from SEPS is through Space and Contents Reports; the Space Report is the Program for 
Design (PFD), the Content Report is the Project Room Contents (PRC). Inclusion of a 
Functional Area as well as Room quantity (Q) and determination of the room area (NSF) 
in the PFD is based on the projected Workload input which triggers calculations included 
in the Room Criteria Statements (RCSs). The RCSs are placed immediately after each 
room name, room code and baseline area (NSF). The PRC list the medical equipment, 
furniture and fixtures associated to each Room Code in the project. The PFD & PRC are 
the baseline requirements for the planning phase of a VA project based on a site’s 
projected workload for the target planning year. This chapter’s corresponding PG-18-12, 
Design Guide -if available- is intended for use during the design phase of the project. 
E. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Intensive 
Care Patient Care Units (ICU PCUs) Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as 
the basis for this chapter. The ICU PCUs SPCM lists all the spaces a VA ICU PCUs site 
would require; the quantity and NSF for each room is calculated based on the ICU PCUs 
projected workload or number of FTE positions authorized. The SPCM is organized in 3 
ranges, each range represents an incremental workload value of 32 patient rooms, this 
way all current VA ICU PCUs sites are covered, the upper ranges are calculated for 
future facilities in case a higher projected workload or FTE positions authorized than 
those at the present time for ICU PCUs. 
F. The SPCM metrics are translated into one (or more) Room Criteria Statement (RCS) for 
each room in Section 5 of this document. The SPCM Planning Range, the maximum 
number of directly workload-driven patient bedroom, in this document is 45. If a project 
shall require provision of workload driven rooms above the maximum range value) refer 
to CFM for guidance. Rooms in this space planning document are organized in 8 
Functional Areas (FAs). 
G. Based on its intended function, each room / space is assigned a: 
1. Room Name (RN), 
2. Room Code (RC), 
3. Room Area, the Net Square Feet (NSF) and its corresponding “soft metric” Net 
Square Meters (NSM), 
4. Unique Room Criteria Statement(s) (RCSs) correlated to answers to Input Data 
Statements (IDSs), and 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
102 – Intensive Care Patient Care Unit (IC PCU) 
8 of 17 
5. Room Comment as needed. 
H. The Room Codes included in this chapter stem from the VA Room Family. A unique 
support space, that may have variable area, is assigned a unique Room Code and adopts 
the square footage, as needed, correlated to the room contents assigned which in turn 
correspond to the range for those rooms. A unique clinical space or a direct clinical 
support room, i.e., control room, system components room, etc. typically does not 
feature variable NSF. Patient Care room names for rooms unique to this chapter end in 
“, IC PCU”. Patient Care Support room names end in “, Bldg Sprt”, “Clncl Sprt”, “Stff 
Sprt”, or “, Vet Sprt”, correlating to Building, Clinical, Staff or Veteran Support room 
families. 
I. Section 5, Sub-Section I lists the SEPS Importer Shortcuts used for implementation of 
Sections 4 & 5 in SEPS. These shortcuts are inserted into the Room Criteria Statement 
(RCS) for each room which upon upload into the Space and Equipment Planning System 
(SEPS) allowing planners developing VA healthcare projects to determine quantity and 
square footage of each room by performing mathematical or logical calculations. 
Shortcuts refer to Input Data Statements (IDSs), Rooms, or calculation parameters 
stemming from the SPCM. 
J. SEPS is accessible to government healthcare planners and private sector consultants 
working on VA HC projects during their Period of Performance (PoP) through the 
MAX.gov website. 
K. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross factor (NTDG) factor of 1.65 for Intensive 
Care Patient Care Units (ICU PCUs) and a Building Gross factor of 1.35 in the space 
calculation to generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building 
Gross Square Feet (BGSF) respectively for the project based on the aggregate resulting 
Net Square Feet (NSF) for each range. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the 
NTDG factor is fixed. 
L. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-5 Equipment Guidelist for the Room Content 
assignment for each room during the planning phase of a project. 
M. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-12: Design Guide, if available, during the 
planning and design phases of a project. Not all PG-18-9 clinical chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 document, please refer to the VA-TIL. 
N. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website.

B. Separation of patient, visitor, and support traffic should be considered to the greatest 
extent possible, and should be considered in the placement of the bed tower and in 
connections to ancillary services. 
C. Standardization of rooms and modular design should be considered to allow flexibility to 
adapt to new technologies and respond to changes in patient volumes. 
D. Design should accommodate patient privacy and confidentiality in all areas, and in 
reception and patient care areas in particular. This includes visual and auditory 
considerations. 
E. Where possible, the department should be configured to limit the mix of patient and 
service functions, and to maintain clear separation of clean and dirty functions to avoid 
cross contamination. 
F. Corridors should be designed to a minimum of 8 feet clear width to accommodate 
passage of equipment or beds and two stretchers and/or wheelchairs. 
G. Administration and support areas should be located and designed to maximize staff and 
space efficiency, and reduce staff travel distances.

1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines Space Planning Criteria for Chapter 104: SCI/D Center. It applies to 
all clinical services provided at a SCI/D Center (Hub) for Acute Care patients, Long Term Care 
Residents and Outpatient services in all medical facilities at the Department of Veterans 
Affairs (VA). Pertinent Sections of this document have been implemented in the Space and 
Equipment Planning System (SEPS) so that planners working on SCI/D Center (Hub) new 
footprint or renovation projects can create baseline space plans based on this Standard. 
In addition, this document outlines Space Planning Criteria for SCI/D Spokes at the 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Pertinent Sections of this document have been 
implemented in the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) so that planners working 
on SCI/D Spoke new footprint or renovation projects can create baseline space plans based 
on this Standard. 
The following policy documents have been reviewed, referenced and incorporated as 
appropriate: 
VHA Directive 1176.01: Spinal Cord Injury and Disorders (SCI/D) System of Care, September 
30, 2019, Amended February 7, 2020. 
OMB Memorandum M-12-12: Promoting Efficient Spending to Support Agency Operations, 
May 11, 2012 (Section 3: Freeze the Footprint) 
2 DEFINITIONS

3 of 79 
SCI/D Spoke facilities. SCI/D-educated primary care teams in SCI/D Spoke facilities 
integrated with SCI/D Centers is a practice unique to VA. Veterans can receive care for 
relatively uncomplicated health care issues closer to home in SCI/D Spokes. More complex 
problems are referred to the SCI/D Center. 
Spinal Cord Injury / Disorders Center (SCI/D): A specialized medical facility designed to 
provide a full range of care for patients who have sustained a lesion of the spinal cord or 
cauda equine resulting in either paraplegia or tetraplegia. SCI/D Centers care is divided into 
three modalities: Acute Care, Outpatient Care and Long Term Care. 
SCI/D Center Acute Care (SCI/D AC): An inpatient SCI/D component intended for short term 
patient care and staffed by a multidisciplinary team including medical, nursing, nutrition, 
social work, psychology, spiritual care as well as therapy services (in all its modalities). 
SCI/D Center Acute Care Patient Care Unit (AC-PCU) Area: A 10-bed unit composed of single 
patient bedrooms, one Airborne Infection Isolation suite, and, if authorized, a double 
patient bedroom and all their support spaces. Space criteria in this document was 
developed for a range of between 1 and 100 Acute Care beds authorized. 
SCI/D Center Acute Care Patient Care Unit (AC-PCU) Common Area: An Acute Care 
Functional Area directly supporting all the SCI/D Center Acute Care Patient Care Units (ACPCUs).

SCI/D Center Long Term Care (SCI/D LTC): A resident SCI/D component intended for long 
term resident care and staffed by a multidisciplinary team including medical, nursing, 
nutrition, social work, psychology, spiritual care as well as therapy services (in all its 
modalities). Provision of the Long Term Care spaces is based on the Small House (formerly 
CLC) concept, refer to PG-18-9 Chapter 104. 
SCI/D Center Long Term Care Home (LTC-H) Area: A 6-bed Home composed of single 
resident bedrooms, one Airborne Infection Isolation suite, and, if authorized, a double 
resident bedroom and all their support spaces, including a Neighborhood Center. Space 
criteria in this document was developed for a range of between 1 and 65 Long Term Care 
beds authorized. The minimum number of Long Term Care Homes (LTC-Hs) generated is 
two. 
SCI/D Center Long Term Care Neighborhood Center Areas: A grouping of rooms and 
Functional Areas (FAs) which include support, staffing and therapy, in all its modalities, 
spaces in support to the Long Term Care Homes (LTC-Hs). 
SCI/D Center Outpatient (SCI/D OP): An outpatient SCI/D component intended for provision 
of primary outpatient care for spinal cord injury patients and staffed by SCI primary care 
physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, technicians and support personnel. Calculation of 
the number of OP Exam/Treatment Rooms is based on the number of Patient Uniques in 
the facility Registry. Space criteria in this document was developed for a range of between 
38 and 1,762 Patient Uniques.

promote development of research-based SCI initiatives. 
Therapy Area: Therapy areas are provided for all three SCI/D Center service levels: Acute 
Care (AC), Long Term Care (LTC) and Outpatient (OP) and include Recreational Therapy (RT), 
Physical Therapy (PT), Kinesiotherapy (KT), Occupational Therapy (OT), and Aquatic 
Therapy. Space planning criteria is developed so that in cases SCI/D Center Acute Care (AC) 
and SCI/D Center Outpatient are concurrently planned, the Acute Care (AC) Therapy spaces 
are sized to serve both Acute Care (AC) and Outpatient (OP) therapy patients; and, in cases 
Outpatient (OP) spaces are planned and no Acute Care (AC) is provided, the Outpatient (OP) 
therapy areas are sized based on the number of Outpatient Exam / Treatment Rooms. 
Urodynamics: Testing that assesses how the bladder and urethra are performing their job of 
storing and releasing urine. Urodynamics will provide the physician with information 
needed to diagnose the cause and nature of a patient’s incontinence in order to prescribe 
most effect treatment option. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Accessible: A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with provisions outlined 
in the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA). 
Architectural Barriers Act (ABA): A set of standards developed to ensure that all buildings 
financed with federal funds are designed and constructed to be fully accessible to everyone. 
This law requires all construction, renovation, or leasing of sites, facilities, buildings, and 
other elements, financed with federal funds, to comply with the Architectural Barriers Act 
Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). The ABAAS replaces the Uniform Federal Accessibility 
Standards (UFAS). 
Average Length of Encounter (ALoE): Averaged length of time, in minutes, a patient spends 
in an Exam / Treatment Room interacting with a provider and the clinical support team. It is 
accounted from room “set-up” to “clean-up” by staff. This metric is used to determine the 
number of annual patient / provider encounters that take place in an Exam / Treatment 
Room which, in turn, is used to calculate the number of Exam / Treatment Rooms needed in 
a facility based on projected annual workload. The ALoE is determined with VHA SME input 
during a PG-18-9 clinical chapter revision / update. 
Average Length of Stay (ALoS): The average number of days a patient Veteran stays in an 
inpatient care unit. The ALoS is used to calculate the number of patient bedrooms for a 
specialty by dividing the site’s projected workload by the ALoS. 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS.

/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
Room Efficiency Factor: A factor that provides flexibility in the utilization of a room to 
account for patient delays, scheduling conflicts, and equipment maintenance. Common 
factors are in the 75% to 85% range. A room with 80% room efficiency provides a buffer to 
assume that this room would be available 20% of the time beyond the planned operational 
practices for this room. This factor may be adjusted based on the actual and/or anticipated 
operations and processes of the room/department at a particular facility. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists

SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
Stop Code: A measure of workload including clinic stops forecasted by the Office of Policy 
and Planning (OPP) for all Strategic Planning Categories at Medical Center and Outpatient 
Clinic levels.

online support groups, online health information and self-management tools, email and 
online communication with health care providers, remote monitoring of vital signs, video, 
or online doctor visits. Depending on the concept of operations for this space, it may be 
equipped as an exam room or as a consult room with video/camera capability. 
Utilization Rate: A factor used in the calculation of a directly workload-driven room 
throughput. It represents, in a percent value, the room is idle based on the planning 
assumptions. For example, if a directly workload-driven room is available for use 8 hours a 
day, the Utilization Rate represents the assumed time it will be used, an 85% utilization rate 
indicates, for planning purposes, the room will be used 6.8 hours a day. An additional 
directly workload-driven room will be provided in the calculation once the previous room 
has reached 100% utilization. The utilization Rate is embedded in the Room Throughput 
value calculated in Section 3 of this document. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
104 – Spinal Cord Injury / Disorders Center (SCI/D) 
8 of 79 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
Workstation: Area outfitted with equipment and furnishings, typically allocated 56 NSF 
each. Managers and other staff with no direct reports as well as part-time, seasonal, and 
job-sharing staff may qualify for a workstation. Such environments are particularly 
conducive to team-oriented office groupings. These environments work best when they 
have access to conference and small group meeting spaces. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space planning criteria have been developed based on research of the clinical and nonclinical
activities involved in various functional areas of VA SCI/D Centers (Hubs) and SCI 
Spokes. These criteria are predicated on established and/or anticipated best practice 
standards as well as applicable policy requirements for VA SCI/D Centers. These criteria 
are subject to modification and adjustment relative to developments in state-of-the-art 
equipment, medical practice, and subsequent planning and design. 
Space Planning Criteria for the SCI/ D Center (Hub) clinical and support functions are 
organized in four distinct Sections in this document: 
1. SCI/D Center Acute Care (AC), 
2. SCI/D Center Long Term Care (LTC), 
3. SCI/D Center Outpatient (OP), 
4. SCI/D Center, and 
5. SCI Spoke (Space Planning Criteria for the SCI/ D Spokes clinical and support 
functions are all consolidated in this Section)

5. SCI Spoke 
a. FA43: SCI Spoke 
Each Room / space in a Functional Area (FA) based on its intended function is assigned 
a: 
1. Room Name (RN), 
2. Unique Room Code (RC), 
3. Room Area expressed in Net Square Feet (NSF) and Net Square Meters (NSM), its 
corresponding “soft” metric equivalent, 
4. Unique Room Criteria Statement (RCS), and 
5. Room Comment if available. 
These five elements for each room as well as its corresponding Input Data Statements 
(IDSs) are implemented in the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS). Planners 
working on VA SCI/D projects develop baseline space programs or Programs for Design 
(PFDs) for SCI/D Center projects by providing answers to the Input Data Statements 
(IDSs). 
B. Determination of the number of Acute Care Patient Care Units (AC PCUs) and Long Term 
Care Resident Homes (LTC-Hs) for a project is based on the number of AC Patient Beds 
and LTC Resident Beds authorized for each site (facility). Determination of the number 
of Outpatient Exam / Treatment Rooms for a project is based on the number of Patient 
Uniques in the Registry for a facility; this number is then translated into workload using 
the VA national average of 9.79 annual outpatient visits for SCI patients. The number 
and size in Net Square Feet (NSF) of each space in the Reception, Support and Therapy 
Functional Areas, the indirectly workload-driven rooms, is subsequently determined via 
ratios and metrics from the resulting number of directly workload-driven AC Patient 
Care Units, LTC Homes and OP Exam/Treatment Rooms. Staff and administrative as well 
as Education spaces are determined by information entered in response to Mission and 
Staffing Input Data Statements (IDSs). 
C. The provision / calculation of the SCI/D AC Patient Bedrooms, SCI/D LTC Resident 
Bedrooms and Outpatient Exam / Treatment Rooms, the directly workload-driven 
rooms, is based on answers to the workload Input Data Statements via mathematical or 
logical formulae. The calculation of the indirectly workload-driven rooms, most of them 
in the Reception, Support and Therapy Functional Areas (FAs) is based on ratios to the 
directly workload-driven rooms. The ratios are provided in three “bands” (lower, 
intermediate & upper) for SCI/D Center Acute Care (SC) and in two “bands”: (lower & 
upper) for SCI/D Center Long Term Care (LTC) and SCI/D Center Outpatient (OP). As 
there are several rooms that are provided via answers to Staffing or Mission Input Data 
Statements (IDSs), planner shall correlate these answers to the workload levels provided 
for the project. 
D. Provision / calculation of the SCI Spoke Clinic Exam/ Treatment Rooms is based on the 
number of Unique SCI Patients in the facility Registry. All the spaces needed in a SCI 
Spoke are included in one Functional Area. These spaces are provided in VAMCs where 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
104 – Spinal Cord Injury / Disorders Center (SCI/D) 
11 of 79 
an SCI/D Center is not provided as a way to reach out the SCI patient ambulatory 
population in the facility area of influence. 
E. The Room Codes included in this chapter are included in the VA Room Family. Per this 
effort, a space may have various Room Codes assigned to the same Room Name, based 
on its Room Content (PG-18-5) assignment which corresponds to its intended function 
level, yielding a different room square footage (NSF). 
F. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website. 
G. Workload Projections or workload level authorized for SCI/D services for a specific VA 
medical center or hospital project are provided by the VHA Support Service Center 
(VSSC) or VA Central Office (VACO). The workload projections are generated by 
methodology based upon the expected veteran population in the respective market / 
service area. Healthcare planners working on VA Medical Center (VAMC) or hospital 
projects will utilize this projected workload as well as specific Mission and Staffing 
information to generate the Baseline Space Program or Program for Design (PFD) for the 
project. The Input Data Statements (IDSs) eliciting this information are included in 
Section 4 for SCI/D Center Acute Care (AC), Section 6 for SCI/D Center Long Term Care 
(LTC), Section 8 for SCI/D Center Outpatient (OP) and Section 10 for SCI/D Center. These 
IDSs are also implemented in the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS), 
accessible through the MAX.gov website, so that planners working in VA SCI/D projects 
can develop baseline Programs for Design by answering the IDSs. 
H. The Functional Area Criteria Statements (FACSs) define the conditions applied to all 
rooms in the Functional Area in addition to specific conditions that may be listed for 
certain rooms in each Room Criteria Statement (RCS). Both FACSs & RCSs use shortcuts 
to link answers in the Input Data Statements (IDSs), certain rooms, or to perform certain 
intermediate calculations applied in the generation of the Program for Design (PFD) for 
a project. 
I. The Therapy Areas in Functional Areas 7 to 11 shall be provided if a project incorporates 
the Acute Care (AC) component or a combined Acute Care (AC) and Outpatient (OP) 
components. The Therapy Areas in Functional Areas 31 to 35 shall be provided if a 
project incorporates an Outpatient (OP) component only. This arrangement is reflected 
in baseline Program for Design (PFD) created in SEPS once those conditions are met. 
J. Refer to PG-18-5: SCI/D Center Equipment Guidelist for the Room Content assignment 
for each room included in this document. 
K. Refer to PG-18-12: SCI/D Center Design Guide for additional planning and design 
information and for Room Guideplates for selected rooms in this document.

L. The following Sections in this document have been implemented and tested in the 
Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) and are available for developing projects 
for SCI/D Center Acute Care (AC), SCI/D Center Long Term Care (LTC) and SCI/D Center 
Outpatient (OP) components: 
1. Section 4: Input Data Statements: SCI/D Center Acute Care (AC), 
2. Section 5: Space Planning Criteria: SCI/D Center Acute Care (AC), 
3. Section 6: Input Data Statements: SCI/D Center Long Term Care (LTC), 
4. Section 7: Space Planning Criteria: SCI/D Center Long Term Care (LTC), 
5. Section 8: Input Data Statements: SCI/D Center Outpatient (OP), 
6. Section 9: Space Planning Criteria: SCI/D Center Outpatient (OP), 
7. Section 10: Input Data Statements: SCI/D Center, 
8. Section 11: Space Planning Criteria: SCI/D Center. 
9. Section 12: Input Data Statements: SCI Spoke, and 
10. Section 13: Space Planning Criteria: SCI Spoke. 
M. These criteria are subject to modification relative to development in the equipment, 
medical practice, vendor requirements, and subsequent planning and design. The 
selection of the size and type of SCI/D equipment is determined by VACO upon Veterans 
Health Administration (VHA) anticipated medical needs. 
N. Calculation of the SCI/D Center OP directly workload-driven rooms is based on the 
following parameters: 
1. Average Number of Annual Encounters for each SCI/D Patient Unique: 9.79 
2. Operating days per year: 250 
3. Hours of Operation per day: 8 
4. Average length of encounter (ALoE) (in minutes): 80 
5. Room Efficiency Factor: 75% 
6. Minimum workload required to generate one Exam / Treatment Room: 25% of 
Annual Encounters per Room 
7. Calculation of the SCI/D Center OP Exam/Treatment Room annual capacity: 
(Operating days per year x Hours of operation per day) ÷ (ALoE ÷60) = Number of 
annual encounters 
Example: 
(250 x 8) ÷ (80 ÷ 60) = 1,500 
The Exam / Treatment Room maximum annual capacity is 1,500 encounters per 
year, assuming 100% utilization. 
SCI/D Center OP Exam/Treatment Room Annual Capacity: 
1,500 x 75% = 1,125 annual encounters 
1,500 x 25% = 375 annual encounters, minimum workload to generate an additional 
room 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
104 – Spinal Cord Injury / Disorders Center (SCI/D) 
13 of 79 
O. Calculation of the number of SCI/D Center OP Exam/Treatment Rooms for a project: 
1. Calculation of projected number of SCI/D Center OP Annual Encounters: 
Number of SCI Patient Uniques in Registry x 9.79 
2. Calculation of the number of SCI/C Center OP Exam/Treatment Rooms: 
SCI Patient Uniques projected annual encounters ÷ Exam / Treatment Room Annual 
Capacity = Number of Rooms 
Example: 
850 Patient Uniques x 9.79 = 8,322 annual encounters 
8,322 annual encounters ÷ 1,125 = 7.40 SCI/D OP Exam/Treatment Rooms 
7 x 1,125 = 7,875 annual encounters 
8,322 – 7,875 = 447 
447 is greater than 375 hence provide an additional room (see Table 1 Col 5) 
8 SCI/D OP Exam/Treatment Rooms will be provided.

The number of SCI/D OP annual encounters per room will be used as a criteria 
parameter to calculate the number of SCI/D OP Exam / Treatment Rooms in the 
Space Criteria section of this document. 
P. Calculation of the number of Spoke Exam / Treatment Rooms for a project 
1. Number of Spoke Exam / Treatment Rooms is based on set annual Patient Unique in 
facility Registry throughput value for each Exam / Treatment Room. This value is set 
at 114 with a minimum of two Exam / Treatment Rooms provided for each SCI 
Spoke. 
Q. The Net-to-Department Gross (NTDG) factor is used to calculate the Departmental Gross 
Square Feet (DGSF) based on the summation of the generated net square footage for 
every room based on calculation of the answers to the Input Data Statements (IDSs) in 
the Room Criteria Statements (RCSs) mathematical and logical formulations. The NTDG 
factor for SCI/D Center is 1.70. The Building Gross Square Feet (BGSF) is calculated by 
multiplying the summation of the DGSFs in all the Departments in a project multiplied 
by the BGSF Factor. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set the BGSF Factor at 1.35.

14 PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. General 
1. This chapter allocates SCI/D Acute Care (AC), SCI/D Long Term Care (LTC), SCI/D 
Outpatient (OP) and SCI/D Center space separately in order to accommodate 
facilities that may need to program these services individually, for example in case of 
renovation projects. In case these services are provided concurrently in a project, 
project planners / designers shall merge Reception, Support and Therapy areas –as 
possible- with concurrence of the local facility officials. 
2. The Program for Design (PFD) Report produced by SEPS based on these criteria is 
intended to be a baseline standardized space program in terms of the number of 
spaces provided for the clinic as well as their net square footage (NSF). A Planner 
may make changes to PFD values for a project, provided reasoning is entered in the 
Comment field of each room affected for approval and approval is granted by 
reviewing government official; same principle applies to the Project Room Contents 
(PRC). 
3. Medical Diagnostic Equipment shall comply with the US Access Board 36 CFR Part 
1195 Standards for Accessible Medical Diagnostic Equipment.

1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines Space Planning Criteria for Chapter 106: Small House (SH) Model. It 
applies to Small House (SH) projects developed as both new construction and renovation 
projects for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The resulting design solutions can be either 
free-standing, attached to, or embedded within an existing facility. 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Community Center (CC): Central hub of the Small House Model, providing areas for social 
activities, specialty services, and support functions for Residents. Can also include 
administrative offices. 
Dementia: A symptom complex characterized by intellectual deterioration (including 
disturbances in memory as well as impulse control, language, spatial abilities, judgment, 
etc.) severe enough to interfere with social or occupational functioning. 
Great Room: The Great Room is a large, casual gathering space for holiday and other special 
events in the Community Center. It can also be used on a daily basis by the residents as a 
core social destination. 
House: A short or long-term dwelling place to provide care for 10, 12 or 14 Veteran 
Residents, including private bedrooms and bathrooms, along with Living, Dining, Kitchen, 
and other support areas in a non-institutional setting. 
Multipurpose / Activity Room: The Multipurpose room provides space for large group 
events and resources for structured activities. The space is sized to accommodate residents 
in an auditorium type setting using stacking chairs or for major events such as a holiday 
party with a mix of seating and standing. Activities that may occur in this space include but 
are not limited to wet / dry arts and crafts, bingo, cards and board games, fitness classes 
and activities, etc. 
Neighborhood Center: Its purpose is to provide the space and opportunity for residents of 
three contiguous houses to interact and socialize in a communal setting. The Neighborhood 
Center includes a multi-purpose / activity room for gatherings and structured activities. 
PT / OT Exercise Gym: This room is equipped to provide physical and occupational therapy 
such as treadmills, weight machines, and therapy mats. 
(Snoezelen) Sensory Therapy Room: A Snoezelen Room is a therapeutic environment 
created for the express purpose of delivering high levels of stimuli to residents with 
dementia. A private room displays optical illusions with combined lighting effects, aromas, 
colors, textures and sounds to stimulate a person’s sensory systems. 
(Namaste) Sensory Therapy Room: A Namaste Room is designed to surround residents with 
soothing sounds of nature, music and calming aromas similar to a spa. Residents who can 
no longer participate in traditional activities or tolerate too much stimulation can receive 
individualized care in a quiet, welcoming space. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
106 – Small House (SH) Model 
3 of 30 
Small House (SH) Model: A VA facility or department designed to provide skilled nursing and 
rehabilitation services for the short or long term care needs of Veterans in a residential 
environment. Components that make up the SHM include the House, the Neighborhood 
Center, and the Community Center. 
VA Medical Center (VAMC): A VA hospital facility that provides a diverse range of health 
care services to Veterans. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Accessible: A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with provisions outlined 
in the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA). 
Architectural Barriers Act (ABA): A set of standards developed to ensure that all buildings 
financed with federal funds are designed and constructed to be fully accessible to everyone. 
This law requires all construction, renovation, or leasing of sites, facilities, buildings, and 
other elements, financed with federal funds, to comply with the Architectural Barriers Act 
Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). The ABAAS replaces the Uniform Federal Accessibility 
Standards (UFAS). 
Average Length of Encounter (ALoE): Averaged length of time, in minutes, a patient spends 
in an Exam / Treatment Room interacting with a provider and the clinical support team. It is 
accounted from room “set-up” to “clean-up” by staff. This metric is used to determine the 
number of annual patient / provider encounters that take place in an Exam / Treatment 
Room which, in turn, is used to calculate the number of Exam / Treatment Rooms needed in 
a facility based on projected annual workload. The ALoE is determined with VHA SME input 
during a PG-18-9 clinical chapter revision / update. 
Average Length of Stay (ALoS): The average number of days a patient Veteran stays in an 
inpatient care unit. The ALoS is used to calculate the number of patient bedrooms for a 
specialty by dividing the site’s projected workload by the ALoS. 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Clinic Stop: Per these criteria, a clinic stop is the workload unit of measure for space 
planning. Clinic Stops are codified by VSSC, when applicable, they are referenced by number 
in the calculation of workload driven patient care spaces in this document. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area.

Encounter: An interaction between a patient Veteran and a VA provider or providers in an 
Exam Room / Treatment Room / Consultation Room / Procedure Room, spaces where a 
patient Veteran received clinical care. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Patient Unique: (or Unique Patient), A Veteran patient counted as a unique in each division 
from which they receive care. Patient Uniques are included in the Registry for a VA Medical 
Center. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs.  
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
106 – Small House (SH) Model 
5 of 30 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Provider: An individual who examines, diagnoses, treats, prescribes medication, and 
manages the care of patients within his or her scope of practice as established by the 
governing body of a healthcare organization. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
Room Efficiency Factor: A factor that provides flexibility in the utilization of a room to 
account for patient delays, scheduling conflicts, and equipment maintenance. Common 
factors are in the 75% to 85% range. A room with 80% room efficiency provides a buffer to 
assume that this room would be available 20% of the time beyond the planned operational 
practices for this room. This factor may be adjusted based on the actual and/or anticipated 
operations and processes of the room/department at a particular facility. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
106 – Small House (SH) Model 
6 of 30 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
Stop Code: A measure of workload including clinic stops forecasted by the Office of Policy 
and Planning (OPP) for all Strategic Planning Categories at Medical Center and Outpatient 
Clinic levels. 
Telehealth: The use of technology, such as computers and mobile devices, to manage 
healthcare remotely. It includes a variety of health care services, including but not limited to 
online support groups, online health information and self-management tools, email and 
online communication with health care providers, remote monitoring of vital signs, video, 
or online doctor visits. Depending on the concept of operations for this space, it may be 
equipped as an exam room or as a consult room with video/camera capability. 
Utilization Rate: A factor used in the calculation of a directly workload-driven room 
throughput. It represents, in a percent value, the room is idle based on the planning 
assumptions. For example, if a directly workload-driven room is available for use 8 hours a 
day, the Utilization Rate represents the assumed time it will be used, an 85% utilization rate 
indicates, for planning purposes, the room will be used 6.8 hours a day. An additional 
directly workload-driven room will be provided in the calculation once the previous room 
has reached 100% utilization. The utilization Rate is embedded in the Room Throughput 
value calculated in Section 3 of this document. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
106 – Small House (SH) Model 
7 of 30 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
Workstation: Area outfitted with equipment and furnishings, typically allocated 56 NSF 
each. Managers and other staff with no direct reports as well as part-time, seasonal, and 
job-sharing staff may qualify for a workstation. Such environments are particularly 
conducive to team-oriented office groupings. These environments work best when they 
have access to conference and small group meeting spaces. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space planning criteria included in this Standard have been specifically developed for 
this Department / Service in a Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare facility based 
on established VHA policy and guidelines to define the scope of services provided for 
the veterans existing workload demand as well as that in the foreseeable future. Rooms 
and Functional Areas are provided based on research of clinical and non-clinical 
activities performed in this Department. 
B. Development / update of VA’s Program Guide (PG) standards is a research based effort 
executed with participation of VHA Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), VA-Construction and 
Facilities Management Office (CFM) professional staff and specialty consultants hired for 
the task. These space planning standards are based on current applicable VHA policies 
and guidelines, established and/or anticipated best practice standards, and latest 
medical technology developments. Workload metrics were tailored to satisfy current 
and anticipated veteran workload demand. 
C. The number of resident bedrooms in a House shall be 10, 12 or 14. 
D. A Neighborhood Center should be provided if the projected number of resident 
bedrooms generates three Houses; an additional Neighborhood Center should be 
provided for every additional increment of three Houses. 
E. A Community Center shall be provided if it is authorized and if the projected number of 
resident bedrooms generates six or more Houses. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022

F. The space planning component of PG-18-9 is based on the Space Planning Concept 
Matrix (SPCM) which lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and assigns room 
quantity (Q) and area (NSF) for a series of ranges corresponding to the smallest to the 
largest department for this service in the VA healthcare system in incremental size; each 
range corresponds to a workload parameter which determines the number and area of 
each directly workload-driven room. The rest of the rooms in the range i.e., waiting, 
storage, staff workstations, etc. are determined by ratios to the resulting number of or 
NSF of the workload-driven rooms. 
G. Sections 4 and 5 of these space planning standards as well as the PG-18-5 standard are 
implemented in the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) and hosted at the 
MAX.gov website so planners working on VA Construction projects can develop single or 
multi-department projects based on these -PG-18-9- and the PG-18-5 standards. Output 
from SEPS is through Space and Contents Reports; the Space Report is the Program for 
Design (PFD), the Content Report is the Project Room Contents (PRC). Inclusion of a 
Functional Area as well as Room quantity (Q) and determination of the room area (NSF) 
in the PFD is based on the projected Workload input which triggers calculations included 
in the Room Criteria Statements (RCSs). The RCSs are placed immediately after each 
room name, room code and baseline area (NSF). The PRC list the medical equipment, 
furniture and fixtures associated to each Room Code in the project. The PFD & PRC are 
the baseline requirements for the planning phase of a VA project based on a site’s 
projected workload for the target planning year. This chapter’s corresponding PG-18-12, 
Design Guide -if available- is intended for use during the design phase of the project. 
H. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Small House 
Model Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as the basis for this chapter. 
The Small House Model SPCM lists all the spaces a VA Small House Model site would 
require; the quantity and NSF for each room is calculated based on the Small House 
Model projected workload or number of FTE positions authorized. The SPCM is 
organized in twelve 10-Resident House ranges, ten 12-Resident House ranges, nine 14Resident
House ranges, and one range for the Community Center (CC), each range 
represents an incremental variable workload depending on number of residents per 
house, this way all current VA Small House Model sites are covered, the upper ranges 
are calculated for future facilities in case a higher projected workload or FTE positions 
authorized than those at the present time for Small House Model. 
I. The SPCM metrics are translated into one (or more) Room Criteria Statement (RCS) for 
each room in Section 5 of this document. The SPCM Planning Range, the maximum 
number of directly workload-driven resident bedrooms, in this document is up to 126. If 
a project shall require provision of workload driven rooms above the maximum range 
value) refer to CFM for guidance. Rooms in this space planning document are organized 
in 12 Functional Areas (FAs).

J. Based on its intended function, each room / space is assigned a: 
1. Room Name (RN), 
2. Room Code (RC), 
3. Room Area, the Net Square Feet (NSF) and its corresponding “soft metric” Net 
Square Meters (NSM), 
4. Unique Room Criteria Statement(s) (RCSs) correlated to answers to Input Data 
Statements (IDSs), and 
5. Room Comment as needed. 
K. The Room Codes included in this chapter stem from the VA Room Family. A unique 
support space, that may have variable area, is assigned a unique Room Code and adopts 
the square footage, as needed, correlated to the room contents assigned which in turn 
correspond to the range for those rooms. A unique clinical space or a direct clinical 
support room, i.e., control room, system components room, etc. typically does not 
feature variable NSF. Patient Care room names for rooms unique to this chapter end in 
“, Sml Hs”. Patient Care Support room names end in “, Bldg Sprt”, “Clncl Sprt”, “Stff 
Sprt”, or “, Vet Sprt”, correlating to Building, Clinical, Staff or Veteran Support room 
families. 
L. Section 5, Sub-Section M lists the SEPS Importer Shortcuts used for implementation of 
Sections 4 & 5 in SEPS. These shortcuts are inserted into the Room Criteria Statement 
(RCS) for each room which upon upload into the Space and Equipment Planning System 
(SEPS) allowing planners developing VA healthcare projects to determine quantity and 
square footage of each room by performing mathematical or logical calculations. 
Shortcuts refer Input Data Statements (IDSs), Rooms or calculation parameters 
stemming from the SPCM. 
M. SEPS is accessible to government healthcare planners and private sector consultants 
working on VA HC projects during their Period of Performance (PoP) through the 
MAX.gov website; government provided Training is a requisite for access. 
N. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross factor (NTDG) factor of 1.60 for Small 
House Model and a Building Gross factor of 1.35 in the space calculation to generate the 
Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross Square Feet (BGSF) 
respectively for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet (NSF) for 
each range. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the NTDG factor is fixed. 
O. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-5 Equipment Guidelist for the Room Content 
assignment for each room during the planning phase of a project. 
P. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-12: Design Guide, if available, during the 
planning and design phases of a project. Not all PG-18-9 clinical chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 document, please refer to the VA-TIL. 
Q. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website.

Management (CFM) Handbooks, Standards, Details, and Design Guides for additional 
planning and design criteria. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
106 – Small House (SH) Model 
25 of 30 
B. The House (SH) shall be a self-contained unit designed following the planning and design 
guidelines set forth in PG-18-12: Small House (SH) Model Design Guide to create a 
unique residential environment, a home for the Veterans. 
C. The House shall be developed around the Living Room, the Kitchen, and the Dining 
Room, the core of the home environment. 
D. The Kitchen and Pantry are equipped to support preparation of all meals for the 
Residents either completely from scratch on site, or with support from a remote central 
kitchen in the parent facility. Refer to PG-18-12 Small House (SH) Model Design Guide 
for additional details. 
E. Resident Bedrooms shall not open directly into “public” areas. The Sitting Alcove is the 
transitional space between the privacy of the Resident Bedroom and the “public” areas 
i.e. Kitchen, Dining Room, Living Room, Den. 
F. Effort should be made to take advantage of natural lighting in the Living Room, Dining 
Room, Kitchen, Den, and Resident bedrooms, as well as all public areas throughout the 
Small House Model. 
G. Consider smaller storage closets dispersed throughout the home, rather than larger 
centralized spaces. 
H. Provide 100% ADA accessibility in all Resident and public spaces throughout the Small 
House Model, both interior and exterior. 
I. Access to exterior space is an important part of the Small House Model concept, and 
should be integrated in to the design as an extension of the living space. Refer to PG-1812
Small House (SH) Model Design Guide for additional details. 
J. The Resident House concept is intended to provide Veterans with a variety of 
environments to choose from, including private space, quiet public space, active public 
space, and outdoor space, allowing them to self-determine their desired level of 
interaction. Refer to PG-18-12 Small House (SH) Model Design Guide for additional 
details. 
K. Reduce or eliminate all institutional accessories or features to the greatest extent 
possible. Minimize wall mounted equipment (paper towels, hand sanitizer, soap 
dispensers, etc.). 
L. Support areas within the House should be located towards the ‘back of house’, away 
from Resident areas. Housekeeping Closets, Clean and Soiled Utility, Linen Storage, 
Receiving Area, Gas Cylinder Storage, Staff Lounge and Toilet, should all be readily 
accessible, but out of the general flow or traffic pattern of the Residents during their 
daily activities. 
M. Minimize the need for supply carts / equipment to be used around the House. 
N. Refer to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management Technical Information Library (www.cfm.va.gov/til/) for additional 
technical criteria.

2 of 33 
1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines space planning criteria for Chapter 110: Mental Health Patient Care 
Unit (MH PCU). It applies to all medical facilities at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
A Mental Health Patient Care Unit is an inpatient mental health program that provides 
inpatient accommodations, delivery of health care, direct supportive facilities, and 
institutional services. Mental Health programs include Psychiatric, Substance Abuse, Drug 
Abuse, and Alcohol Dependency treatment. 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Communications Center: The central control point for the patient unit. 
Center for Addictions Treatment (CAT): The CAT is an alcohol and drug rehabilitation 
program. Addiction services includes detoxification (1-3 days), pre-programming evaluation 
(1-14 days) and an intensive 28-day component designed to impact the veteran’s denial 
system and present the patient with an array of recovery tools. CAT also offers the 
Cornerstone Track and the Balanced Living Track to teach veterans to apply the learned 
recovery tools. 
Health Maintenance Program (HMP): This program provides health maintenance care to 
veterans with chronic medical and psychiatric problems needing long-term maintenance 
care. HMP provides assessment and quality medical care in a supportive environment to 
ADL-independent veterans who require support in the activities of daily living (ADL). Many 
of these veterans are lacking financial resources and the general support necessary for 
transition back into the community. 
Mental Health Patient Care Unit: A Mental Health Patient Care Unit is comprised of a range 
of sixteen and thirty-one beds with associated support spaces. A Mental Health Unit can 
include Psychiatric beds, Substance Abuse beds, Drug Abuse Treatment beds, and Alcohol 
Dependency beds. 
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Residential Rehabilitation Program (PRRP): The PRRP is a 
structured 90-day program focused on helping veterans to move toward resolution of 
feelings associated with their experiences during the war and thereafter. The PRRP helps 
the veterans to better understand the ways traumatic experiences have affected them and 
to prepare them for successful return to community living. PRRP treatment is intended to 
facilitate continuing recovery from a variety of service-related experiences including 
trauma, homecoming and readjustment. 
Provider: An individual who examines, diagnoses, treats, prescribes medication, and 
manages the care of patients within his or her scope of practice as established by the 
governing body of a healthcare organization. 
Traumatic Brain Injury (Mainstream): This program provides cognitive rehabilitation to 
veterans and active duty personnel who have sustained a brain injury and to return those 
persons to the highest level of functioning possible. Mainstream provides a structured 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
110 – Mental Health Patient Care Unit (MH PCU) 
3 of 33 
environment which includes life skills classes, psychosocial groups, recreation activities and 
community outings for the veterans. 
Seclusion: A short-term occupancy by any patient observed to be violent, suicidal, or 
requiring additional direct supervision; the involuntary confinement of a person in a locked 
room (JCAHO, 2000). 
Seclusion Suite: Includes a seclusion room, seclusion anteroom for nurse observation and 
charting, and a seclusion toilet. The suite should be designed to keep the patient under 
direct supervision and should have no furniture or sharp corners of which a patient can 
inflict harm on oneself or others. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Accessible: A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with provisions outlined 
in the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA). 
Architectural Barriers Act (ABA): A set of standards developed to ensure that all buildings 
financed with federal funds are designed and constructed to be fully accessible to everyone. 
This law requires all construction, renovation, or leasing of sites, facilities, buildings, and 
other elements, financed with federal funds, to comply with the Architectural Barriers Act 
Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). The ABAAS replaces the Uniform Federal Accessibility 
Standards (UFAS). 
Average Length of Encounter (ALoE): Averaged length of time, in minutes, a patient spends 
in an Exam / Treatment Room interacting with a provider and the clinical support team. It is 
accounted from room “set-up” to “clean-up” by staff. This metric is used to determine the 
number of annual patient / provider encounters that take place in an Exam / Treatment 
Room which, in turn, is used to calculate the number of Exam / Treatment Rooms needed in 
a facility based on projected annual workload. The ALoE is determined with VHA SME input 
during a PG-18-9 clinical chapter revision / update. 
Average Length of Stay (ALoS): The average number of days a patient Veteran stays in an 
inpatient care unit. The ALoS is used to calculate the number of patient bedrooms for a 
specialty by dividing the site’s projected workload by the ALoS. 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Clinic Stop: Per these criteria, a clinic stop is the workload unit of measure for space 
planning. Clinic Stops are codified by VSSC, when applicable, they are referenced by number 
in the calculation of workload driven patient care spaces in this document. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
110 – Mental Health Patient Care Unit (MH PCU) 
4 of 33 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Encounter: An interaction between a patient Veteran and a VA provider or providers in an 
Exam Room / Treatment Room / Consultation Room / Procedure Room, spaces where a 
patient Veteran received clinical care. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Patient Unique: (or Unique Patient), A Veteran patient counted as a unique in each division 
from which they receive care. Patient Uniques are included in the Registry for a VA Medical 
Center. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
110 – Mental Health Patient Care Unit (MH PCU) 
5 of 33 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Provider: An individual who examines, diagnoses, treats, prescribes medication, and 
manages the care of patients within his or her scope of practice as established by the 
governing body of a healthcare organization. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
Room Efficiency Factor: A factor that provides flexibility in the utilization of a room to 
account for patient delays, scheduling conflicts, and equipment maintenance. Common 
factors are in the 75% to 85% range. A room with 80% room efficiency provides a buffer to 
assume that this room would be available 20% of the time beyond the planned operational 
practices for this room. This factor may be adjusted based on the actual and/or anticipated 
operations and processes of the room/department at a particular facility. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
110 – Mental Health Patient Care Unit (MH PCU) 
6 of 33 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
Stop Code: A measure of workload including clinic stops forecasted by the Office of Policy 
and Planning (OPP) for all Strategic Planning Categories at Medical Center and Outpatient 
Clinic levels. 
Telehealth: The use of technology, such as computers and mobile devices, to manage 
healthcare remotely. It includes a variety of health care services, including but not limited to 
online support groups, online health information and self-management tools, email and 
online communication with health care providers, remote monitoring of vital signs, video, 
or online doctor visits. Depending on the concept of operations for this space, it may be 
equipped as an exam room or as a consult room with video/camera capability. 
Utilization Rate: A factor used in the calculation of a directly workload-driven room 
throughput. It represents, in a percent value, the room is idle based on the planning 
assumptions. For example, if a directly workload-driven room is available for use 8 hours a 
day, the Utilization Rate represents the assumed time it will be used, an 85% utilization rate 
indicates, for planning purposes, the room will be used 6.8 hours a day. An additional 
directly workload-driven room will be provided in the calculation once the previous room 
has reached 100% utilization. The utilization Rate is embedded in the Room Throughput 
value calculated in Section 3 of this document. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
110 – Mental Health Patient Care Unit (MH PCU) 
7 of 33 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
Workstation: Area outfitted with equipment and furnishings, typically allocated 56 NSF 
each. Managers and other staff with no direct reports as well as part-time, seasonal, and 
job-sharing staff may qualify for a workstation. Such environments are particularly 
conducive to team-oriented office groupings. These environments work best when they 
have access to conference and small group meeting spaces. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space planning criteria included in this Standard have been specifically developed for 
this Department / Service in a Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare facility based 
on established VHA policy and guidelines to define the scope of services provided for 
the veterans existing workload demand as well as that in the foreseeable future. Rooms 
and Functional Areas are provided based on research of clinical and non-clinical 
activities performed in this Department. 
B. Development / update of VA’s Program Guide (PG) standards is a research based effort 
executed with participation of VHA Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), VA-Construction and 
Facilities Management Office (CFM) professional staff and specialty consultants hired for 
the task. These space planning standards are based on current applicable VHA policies 
and guidelines, established and/or anticipated best practice standards, and latest 
medical technology developments. Workload metrics were tailored to satisfy current 
and anticipated veteran workload demand. 
C. The space planning component of PG-18-9 is based on the Space Planning Concept 
Matrix (SPCM) which lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and assigns room 
quantity (Q) and area (NSF) for a series of ranges corresponding to the smallest to the 
largest department for this service in the VA healthcare system in incremental size; each 
range corresponds to a workload parameter which determines the number and area of 
each directly workload-driven room. The rest of the rooms in the range i.e., waiting, 
storage, staff workstations, etc. are determined by ratios to the resulting number of or 
NSF of the workload-driven rooms. 
D. Sections 4 and 5 of these space planning standards as well as the PG-18-5 standard are 
implemented in the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) and hosted at the 
MAX.gov website so planners working on VA Construction projects can develop single or 
multi-department projects based on these PG-18-9- and the PG-18-5 standards. Output 
from SEPS is through Space and Contents Reports; the Space Report is the Program for 
Design (PFD), the Content Report is the Project Room Contents (PRC). Inclusion of a 
Functional Area as well as Room quantity (Q) and determination of the room area (NSF) 
in the PFD is based on the projected Workload input which triggers calculations included 
in the Room Criteria Statements (RCSs). The RCSs are placed immediately after each 
room name, room code and baseline area (NSF). The PRC list the medical equipment, 
furniture and fixtures associated to each Room Code in the project. The PFD & PRC are 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022

the baseline requirements for the planning phase of a VA project based on a site’s 
projected workload for the target planning year. This chapter’s corresponding PG-18-12, 
Design Guide -if available- is intended for use during the design phase of the project. 
E. Space planning criteria herein reflect the space allocation standards for any MH PCU 
project in the VA System of Care, as such it is not location specific and are applicable to 
all VA facilities providing accommodation for inpatient Mental Health. 
F. Space Planning Criteria herein applies to a VA Mental Health Patient Care Unit (MH PCU) 
project range of between 8 and 100 resident beds in increments of four beds. A planner 
developing a space program for a project with a requirement above or below this range 
shall use these standards as a baseline and manually adjust the Program for Design with 
support of the Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM). 
G. Patient Care Units (PCUs) are sized for 8, 12, 16 and 20 patient beds. Based on these 
four PCU sizes, the total number of Patient Care Units in a project are generated per 
Table 1A and 1B.

Each Room in a FA is assigned a: 
1. Unique Room Name (RN), 
2. Room Code (RC), 
3. Room Area expressed in Net Square Feet (NSF) and Net Square Meters (NSM), its 
corresponding “soft” metric equivalent, 
4. Unique Room Criteria Statement (RCS), and 
5. Room Comment if needed. 
I. Room Area (NSF / NSM) and quantity (Q) of each room for every MH PCU size generated 
in the range above have been calculated in the Space Planning Criteria Concept Matrix; 
they are reflected as conditions in the Room Criteria Statement(s) (RCSs) for each room 
in Section 5. Refer to PG-18-12, Appendix X for the Space Planning Criteria Concept 
Matrix. 
J. Room Criteria Statements (RCSs) are triggered by answers to the Input Data Statements 
(IDSs) in Section 4 and generate a set of spaces whose quantity and area correspond to 
the number of Patient Beds authorized for a MH PCU project in the VA System of Care. 
K. The Room Codes included in this chapter stem from the VA Room Family. A unique 
support space, that may have variable area, is assigned a unique Room Code and adopts 
the square footage, as needed, correlated to the room contents assigned which in turn 
correspond to the range for those rooms. A unique clinical space or a direct clinical 
support room, i.e., control room, system components room, etc. typically does not 
feature variable NSF. Patient Care room names for rooms unique to this chapter end in 
“, MH, PCU”. Patient Care Support room names end in “, Bldg Sprt”, “Clncl Sprt”, “Stff 
Sprt”, or “, Vet Sprt”, correlating to Building, Clinical, Staff or Veteran Support room 
families. 
L. Section 5, Sub-Section I lists the SEPS Importer Shortcuts used for implementation of 
Sections 4 & 5 in SEPS. These shortcuts are inserted into the Room Criteria Statement 
(RCS) for each room which upon upload into the Space and Equipment Planning System 
(SEPS) allowing planners developing VA healthcare projects to determine quantity and 
square footage of each room by performing mathematical or logical calculations. 
Shortcuts refer Input Data Statements (IDSs), Rooms or calculation parameters 
stemming from the SPCM. 
M. SEPS is accessible to government healthcare planners and private sector consultants 
working on VA HC projects during their Period of Performance (PoP) through the 
MAX.gov website; government provided Training is a requisite for access. 
N. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross factor (NTDG) factor of 1.65 for Mental 
Health Patient Care Unit (MH-PCU) and a Building Gross factor of 1.35 in the space 
calculation to generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building 
Gross Square Feet (BGSF) respectively for the project based on the aggregate resulting 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022

6 PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. The MH-PCU is more than an institutional space, it is truly a place that the Veterans can 
recover. It should be designed as a self-contained unit, following the direction outlined 
in the Inpatient Mental Health Design Guide. 
B. The location of the Nurse Station/Hub should afford visibility and control of all areas in 
the patient care unit and visual control of the patients’ rooms. It should be conveniently 
accessible to / from any point within the patient care unit with a maximum distance to 
the farthest patient room not exceeding 120 linear feet. 
C. The Nurse Station/Hub should be open, with passive control measures, such as a high 
and deep counter, to deter climbing or access from the patient side for safety. The Hub 
should be used primarily for unit observation and servicing veteran needs in a 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
110 – Mental Health Patient Care Unit (MH PCU) 
31 of 33 
welcoming manner. An enclosed workroom or meds room should be immediately 
behind the open Nurse Station and used for charting and other focused tasks. 
D. Corridors should be eliminated as much as possible. If required, corridors should be 
designed with a minimum of 8 feet in width, to accommodate passage of two stretchers 
and/or wheelchairs, equipment or beds. 
E. One-bed Patient Rooms are provided to respond to increasing patient acuity, patient 
privacy, and patient safety by minimizing patient transfers. 
F. Two-bed Patient Rooms are provided for patients whose mental diagnosis and 
treatment planning is better served with additional patient interaction. Patients 
requiring machines such as CPAPs can also be grouped in two-bed Patient Rooms with 
one staff observer. 
G. All patient bedrooms will have a private connecting bathroom with toilet, shower, and 
lavatory. 
H. Refer to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Construction and Facilities Management 
Technical Information Library (www.cfm.va.gov/til/) for additional technical criteria. 
7 FUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS 
The concept of Mental Health Patient Care Unit (MH-PCU) services is to provide short-term 
crisis stabilization care in a therapeutic, lockdown environment. One direct way to 
accomplish this is to provide a location within the Medical Center. Where this is not 
practical, effective solutions can be achieved by placing the MH-PCU on an existing campus, 
either as a free-standing structure or adjacent to the Medical Center. 
In all these cases, the MH-PCU is programmed to be effectively self-contained with 
adjacency to or direct support from critical outside departments or services such as the 
Emergency Department. Skilled nursing, medication dispensing, nutrition and dietary needs, 
laundry, and environmental services should all be provided directly within the MH-PCU if 
possible. There can also be solutions where the MH-PCU occupies space within the existing 
facility.

PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
111 – Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center (PRC) 
4 of 35 
Architectural Barriers Act (ABA): A set of standards developed to ensure that all buildings 
financed with federal funds are designed and constructed to be fully accessible to everyone. 
This law requires all construction, renovation, or leasing of sites, facilities, buildings, and 
other elements, financed with federal funds, to comply with the Architectural Barriers Act 
Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). The ABAAS replaces the Uniform Federal Accessibility 
Standards (UFAS). 
Average Length of Encounter (ALoE): Averaged length of time, in minutes, a patient spends 
in an Exam / Treatment Room interacting with a provider and the clinical support team. It is 
accounted from room “set-up” to “clean-up” by staff. This metric is used to determine the 
number of annual patient / provider encounters that take place in an Exam / Treatment 
Room which, in turn, is used to calculate the number of Exam / Treatment Rooms needed in 
a facility based on projected annual workload. The ALoE is determined with VHA SME input 
during a PG-18-9 clinical chapter revision / update. 
Average Length of Stay (ALoS): The average number of days a patient Veteran stays in an 
inpatient care unit. The ALoS is used to calculate the number of patient bedrooms for a 
specialty by dividing the site’s projected workload by the ALoS. 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Clinic Stop: Per these criteria, a clinic stop is the workload unit of measure for space 
planning. Clinic Stops are codified by VSSC, when applicable, they are referenced by number 
in the calculation of workload driven patient care spaces in this document. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Encounter: An interaction between a patient Veteran and a VA provider or providers in an 
Exam Room / Treatment Room / Consultation Room / Procedure Room, spaces where a 
patient Veteran received clinical care. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022

Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Patient Unique: (or Unique Patient), A Veteran patient counted as a unique in each division 
from which they receive care. Patient Uniques are included in the Registry for a VA Medical 
Center. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs.  
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022

6 of 35 
Provider: An individual who examines, diagnoses, treats, prescribes medication, and 
manages the care of patients within his or her scope of practice as established by the 
governing body of a healthcare organization. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
Room Efficiency Factor: A factor that provides flexibility in the utilization of a room to 
account for patient delays, scheduling conflicts, and equipment maintenance. Common 
factors are in the 75% to 85% range. A room with 80% room efficiency provides a buffer to 
assume that this room would be available 20% of the time beyond the planned operational 
practices for this room. This factor may be adjusted based on the actual and/or anticipated 
operations and processes of the room/department at a particular facility. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
Stop Code: A measure of workload including clinic stops forecasted by the Office of Policy 
and Planning (OPP) for all Strategic Planning Categories at Medical Center and Outpatient 
Clinic levels. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022

7 of 35 
Telehealth: The use of technology, such as computers and mobile devices, to manage 
healthcare remotely. It includes a variety of health care services, including but not limited to 
online support groups, online health information and self-management tools, email and 
online communication with health care providers, remote monitoring of vital signs, video, 
or online doctor visits. Depending on the concept of operations for this space, it may be 
equipped as an exam room or as a consult room with video/camera capability. 
Utilization Rate: A factor used in the calculation of a directly workload-driven room 
throughput. It represents, in a percent value, the room is idle based on the planning 
assumptions. For example, if a directly workload-driven room is available for use 8 hours a 
day, the Utilization Rate represents the assumed time it will be actually be used, an 85% 
utilization rate indicates, for planning purposes, the room will be used 6.8 hours a day. An 
additional directly workload-driven room will be provided in the calculation once the 
previous room has reached 100% utilization. The utilization Rate is embedded in the Room 
Throughput value calculated in Section 3 of this document. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
Workstation: Area outfitted with equipment and furnishings, typically allocated 56 NSF 
each. Managers and other staff with no direct reports as well as part-time, seasonal, and 
job-sharing staff may qualify for a workstation. Such environments are particularly 
conducive to team-oriented office groupings. These environments work best when they 
have access to conference and small group meeting spaces.

3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space planning criteria included in this Standard have been specifically developed for 
this Department / Service in a Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare facility based 
on established VHA policy and guidelines to define the scope of services provided for 
existing workload demand as well as that in the foreseeable future. Rooms and 
Functional Areas are provided based on research of clinical and non-clinical activities 
performed in this Department. 
B. Development / update of VA’s Program Guide (PG) standards is a research based effort 
executed with participation of VHA Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), VA-Construction and 
Facilities Management Office (CFM) professional staff and specialty consultants hired for 
the task. These space planning standards are based on current applicable VHA policies 
and guidelines, established and/or anticipated best practice standards, and latest 
medical technology developments. Workload metrics were tailored to satisfy current 
and anticipated veteran workload demand. 
C. The space planning component of PG-18-9 is based on the Space Planning Concept 
Matrix (SPCM) which lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and assigns room 
quantity (Q) and area (NSF) for a series of ranges corresponding to the smallest to the 
largest department for this service in the VA healthcare system in incremental size; each 
range corresponds to a workload parameter which determines the number and area of 
each directly workload-driven room. The rest of the rooms in the range i.e., waiting, 
storage, staff workstations, etc. are determined by ratios to the resulting number of or 
NSF of the workload-driven rooms. 
D. Sections 4 and 5 of these space planning standards as well as the PG-18-5 standard are 
implemented in the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) and hosted at the 
MAX.gov website so planners working on VA Construction projects can develop single or 
multi-department projects based on these PG-18-9- and the PG-18-5 standards. Output 
from SEPS is through Space and Contents Reports; the Space Report is the Program for 
Design (PFD), the Content Report is the Project Room Contents (PRC). Inclusion of a 
Functional Area as well as Room quantity (Q) and determination of the room area (NSF) 
in the PFD is based on the projected Workload input which triggers calculations included 
in the Room Criteria Statements (RCSs). The RCSs are placed immediately after each 
room name, room code and baseline area (NSF). The PRC list the medical equipment, 
furniture and fixtures associated to each Room Code in the project. The PFD & PRC are 
the baseline requirements for the planning phase of a VA project based on a site’s 
projected workload for the target planning year. This chapter’s corresponding PG-18-12, 
Design Guide -if available- is intended for use during the design phase of the project.

E. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Polytrauma 
Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as the basis for this chapter. The 
Polytrauma SPCM lists all the spaces a VA Polytrauma site would require whether for a 
Patient Care Unit (PCU), a Resident Care Unit (RCU) or an Outpatient (OP) clinic ; the 
quantity and NSF for each room is calculated based on the Polytrauma projected 
workload or number of FTE positions authorized. The SPCM is organized in 16 ranges as 
follows: 
1. Range 1: One 12-bed PCU 
2. Range 2: One 18-bed PCU 
3. Range 3: One 10-bed RCU 
4. Range 4: Two 10-bed RCU 
5. Range 5: Polytrauma Stop Code 197 between 384 and 3,840 annual clinic stops, and/or 
EMG Stop Code 212 between 320 and 1,600 annual clinic stops, and/or 
Chiropractic Stop Code 436 between 427 and 2,133 annual clinic stops. 
6. Ranges 6 to 9: Polytrauma Stop Code 197 between 3,841 and 11,520 annual clinic 
stops (in increments of 1,920). 
7. Ranges 10 to 12: EMG Stop Code 212 between 1,601 and 6,400 annual clinic stops 
(in increments of 1,600). 
8. Ranges 13 to 15: Chiropractic Stop Code 436 between 2,134 and 8,532 annual clinic 
stops (in increments of 2,133). 
F. All current VA Polytrauma sites are covered, the upper ranges are calculated for future 
facilities in case a higher projected workload or FTE positions authorized than those at 
the present time for Polytrauma. 
G. The SPCM metrics are translated into one (or more) Room Criteria Statement (RCS) for 
each room in Section 5 of this document. The SPCM Planning Range, the maximum 
number of directly workload-driven patient bedroom, in this document is 12 or 18 for 
the PCU; 10 or 20 for the RCU, six Polytrauma Exam Rooms, four EMG Exam Rooms and 
4 Chiropractic Exam Rooms. If a project shall require provision of workload driven rooms 
above the maximum range value refer to CFM for guidance. Rooms in this space 
planning document are organized in 19 Functional Areas (FAs). 
H. Based on its intended function, each room / space is assigned a: 
1. Room Name (RN), 
2. Room Code (RC), 
3. Room Area, the Net Square Feet (NSF) and its corresponding “soft metric” Net 
Square Meters (NSM), 
4. Unique Room Criteria Statement(s) (RCSs) correlated to answers to Input Data 
Statements (IDSs), and 
5. Room Comment as needed.

I. The Room Codes included in this chapter stem from the VA Room Family. A unique 
support space, that may have variable area, is assigned a unique Room Code and adopts 
the square footage, as needed, correlated to the room contents assigned which in turn 
correspond to the range for those rooms. A unique clinical space or a direct clinical 
support room, i.e., control room, system components room, etc. typically does not 
feature variable NSF. Patient Care room names for rooms unique to this chapter end in 
“, Polytrauma”. Patient Care Support room names end in “, Bldg Sprt”, “Clncl Sprt”, “Stff 
Sprt”, or “, Vet Sprt”, correlating to Building, Clinical, Staff or Veteran Support room 
families. 
J. Section 5, Sub-Section H lists the SEPS Importer Shortcuts used for implementation of 
Sections 4 & 5 in SEPS. These shortcuts are inserted into the Room Criteria Statement 
(RCS) for each room which upon upload into the Space and Equipment Planning System 
(SEPS) allowing planners developing VA healthcare projects to determine quantity and 
square footage of each room by performing mathematical or logical calculations. 
Shortcuts refer Input Data Statements (IDSs), Rooms or calculation parameters 
stemming from the SPCM. 
K. SEPS is accessible to government healthcare planners and private sector consultants 
working on VA HC projects during their Period of Performance (PoP) through the 
MAX.gov website; government provided Training is a requisite for access. 
L. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross factor (NTDG) factor of 1.65 for 
Polytrauma and a Building Gross factor of 1.35 in the space calculation to generate the 
Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross Square Feet (BGSF) 
respectively for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet (NSF) for 
each range. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the NTDG factor is fixed. 
M. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-5 Equipment Guidelist for the Room Content 
assignment for each room during the planning phase of a project. 
N. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-12: Design Guide, if available, during the 
planning and design phases of a project. Not all PG-18-9 clinical chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 document, please refer to the VA-TIL. 
O. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website.

1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines Space Planning Criteria for Chapter 204: Audiology and SpeechLanguage
Pathology Service. It applies to all medical facilities at the Department of Veterans 
Affairs (VA). 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Acoustic Immittance (Tympanometry): A battery of tests that includes tympanometry, 
acoustic reflex threshold testing, and acoustic reflex decay testing. 
Audiologist: A person who, by virtue of academic degree, clinical training, and professional 
credentials, is uniquely qualified to provide independently a comprehensive array of 
professional services related to the prevention of hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction 
and the identification, evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of persons with impairment of 
auditory and vestibular function. The central focus of the profession of audiology is 
concerned with all auditory impairments and their relationship to disorders of 
communication. 
Audiology: A clinical specialty involving the prevention, identification, evaluation and 
remediation, and treatment of hearing loss, tinnitus, and vestibular disorders. 
Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology: A combined service or equivalent service-level 
department within the VA Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology may be physically 
separated. 
Benign Positional Vertigo (BPV): A balance disorder that results in the sudden onset of 
dizziness, spinning, or vertigo, caused by changes in the position of the head. 
Cerumen: A natural wax-like substance secreted by special glands in the skin on the outer 
part of the ear canal. Also referred to as ear wax, cerumen protects the skin of the human 
ear canal, assists in cleaning and lubrication, and provides some protection against bacteria, 
fungi, insects, and water. Excess production and accumulation of cerumen can cause ear 
problems like infection, and temporary hearing loss, if not removed. 
Cochlear Implant: A device that is surgically implanted in the ear to bypass the damaged 
hearing receptors in the cochlea and directly provide electrical stimulation to the hearing 
nerve.  
Ear, Nose Throat (ENT): A branch of medicine and surgery, also known as Otolaryngology or 
ENT that specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the head and neck. 
Electrophysiology: Special diagnostic tests involving the measurement of auditory evoked 
potentials from the cochlea, auditory nerve, brain, or otolith organs including 
electrocochleography, auditory brainstem response (ABR), middle latency potentials (MLR), 
late potentials, vestibular evoked myogenic potentials, and other specialized evoked 
potential techniques. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
204 – Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology (ASLP) Service 
  3 of 32 
Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE): Electrical potentials generated in the inner ear.  Clinically, two 
otoacoustic emissions are measured: transient-evoked OAE (TOAE) and distortion product 
OAE (DPOAE). These measures are used to assess hearing loss objectively. 
Outpatient Clinic: A freestanding ambulatory care facility that is physically separated but 
administratively attached to a VA Medical Center providing a specific set of outpatient 
services. 
Posturography: A battery of tests (also known as Computerized Dynamic Posturography) to 
evaluate balance function using a series of tasks to simulate situations encountered in daily 
life. Tests measure sensory organization, motor control, and proprioceptive aspects of 
balance. Tests can be used to assess postural stability and movement strategies in patients 
who experience disequilibrium or who are prone to falling. 
Speech-Language Pathologist: A person who by virtue of academic degree, clinical training, 
and professional credentials, is uniquely qualified to provide, independently, a 
comprehensive array of professional services related to human communication and 
swallowing. This includes the identification, evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of persons 
with speech, voice, language, fluency, cognitive, swallowing, and respiratory disorders. The 
domain of speech-language pathology includes human communication behaviors and 
disorders, as well as swallowing or other upper aerodigestive functions and disorders. 
Speech-Language Pathology: A clinical specialty involving the prevention, identification, 
evaluation, treatment, and rehabilitation of Speech-Language, voice, fluency, cognitive, and 
swallowing disorders. 
Telehealth: The use of technology, such as computers and mobile devices, to manage 
healthcare remotely. It includes a variety of health care services, including but not limited to 
online support groups, online health information and self-management tools, email and 
online communication with health care providers, remote monitoring of vital signs, video, 
or online doctor visits. Depending on the concept of operations for this space, it may be 
equipped as an exam room or as a consult room with video/camera capability. 
Tracheoesophageal Voice Prosthesis (TEP): A device that is placed in the wall that separates 
the trachea and esophagus to enable a total laryngectomy patient to make voice.  
Vestibulography: A general class of special balance tests including, video-nystagmography 
(VNG), and sinusoidal vertical axis rotational testing (rotary chair). These tests record 
nystagmus and eye movements to diagnosis peripheral and central vestibular disorders. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Accessible: A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with provisions outlined 
in the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA). 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
204 – Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology (ASLP) Service 
  4 of 32 
Architectural Barriers Act (ABA): A set of standards developed to ensure that all buildings 
financed with federal funds are designed and constructed to be fully accessible to everyone. 
This law requires all construction, renovation, or leasing of sites, facilities, buildings, and 
other elements, financed with federal funds, to comply with the Architectural Barriers Act 
Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). The ABAAS replaces the Uniform Federal Accessibility 
Standards (UFAS). 
Average Length of Encounter (ALoE): Averaged length of time, in minutes, a patient spends 
in an Exam / Treatment Room interacting with a provider and the clinical support team. It is 
accounted from room “set-up” to “clean-up” by staff. This metric is used to determine the 
number of annual patient / provider encounters that take place in an Exam / Treatment 
Room which, in turn, is used to calculate the number of Exam / Treatment Rooms needed in 
a facility based on projected annual workload. The ALoE is determined with VHA SME input 
during a PG-18-9 clinical chapter revision / update. 
Average Length of Stay (ALoS): The average number of days a patient Veteran stays in an 
inpatient care unit. The ALoS is used to calculate the number of patient bedrooms for a 
specialty by dividing the site’s projected workload by the ALoS. 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Clinic Stop: Per these criteria, a clinic stop is the workload unit of measure for space 
planning. Clinic Stops are codified by VSSC, when applicable, they are referenced by number 
in the calculation of workload driven patient care spaces in this document. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Encounter: An interaction between a patient Veteran and a VA provider or providers in an 
Exam Room / Treatment Room / Consultation Room / Procedure Room, spaces where a 
patient Veteran received clinical care. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
204 – Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology (ASLP) Service 
  5 of 32 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Patient Unique: (or Unique Patient), A Veteran patient counted as a unique in each division 
from which they receive care. Patient Uniques are included in the Registry for a VA Medical 
Center. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs.  
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
204 – Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology (ASLP) Service 
  6 of 32 
Provider: An individual who examines, diagnoses, treats, prescribes medication, and 
manages the care of patients within his or her scope of practice as established by the 
governing body of a healthcare organization. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
Room Efficiency Factor: A factor that provides flexibility in the utilization of a room to 
account for patient delays, scheduling conflicts, and equipment maintenance. Common 
factors are in the 75% to 85% range. A room with 80% room efficiency provides a buffer to 
assume that this room would be available 20% of the time beyond the planned operational 
practices for this room. This factor may be adjusted based on the actual and/or anticipated 
operations and processes of the room/department at a particular facility. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
Stop Code: A measure of workload including clinic stops forecasted by the Office of Policy 
and Planning (OPP) for all Strategic Planning Categories at Medical Center and Outpatient 
Clinic levels.

Telehealth: The use of technology, such as computers and mobile devices, to manage 
healthcare remotely. It includes a variety of health care services, including but not limited to 
online support groups, online health information and self-management tools, email and 
online communication with health care providers, remote monitoring of vital signs, video, 
or online doctor visits. Depending on the concept of operations for this space, it may be 
equipped as an exam room or as a consult room with video/camera capability. 
Utilization Rate: A factor used in the calculation of a directly workload-driven room 
throughput. It represents, in a percent value, the room is idle based on the planning 
assumptions. For example, if a directly workload-driven room is available for use 8 hours a 
day, the Utilization Rate represents the assumed time it will be used, an 85% utilization rate 
indicates, for planning purposes, the room will be used 6.8 hours a day. An additional 
directly workload-driven room will be provided in the calculation once the previous room 
has reached 100% utilization. The utilization Rate is embedded in the Room Throughput 
value calculated in Section 3 of this document. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
Workstation: Area outfitted with equipment and furnishings, typically allocated 56 NSF 
each. Managers and other staff with no direct reports as well as part-time, seasonal, and 
job-sharing staff may qualify for a workstation. Such environments are particularly 
conducive to team-oriented office groupings. These environments work best when they 
have access to conference and small group meeting spaces.

204 – Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology (ASLP) Service 
  8 of 32 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space planning criteria included in this Standard have been specifically developed for 
this Department / Service in a Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare facility based 
on established VHA policy and guidelines to define the scope of services provided for 
the existing workload demand as well as that in the foreseeable future. Rooms and 
Functional Areas are provided based on research of clinical and non-clinical activities 
performed in this Department. 
B. Development / update of VA’s Program Guide (PG) standards is a research based effort 
executed with participation of VHA Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), VA-Construction and 
Facilities Management Office (CFM) professional staff and specialty consultants hired for 
the task. These space planning standards are based on current applicable VHA policies 
and guidelines, established and/or anticipated best practice standards, and latest 
medical technology developments. Workload metrics were tailored to satisfy current 
and anticipated veteran workload demand. 
C. The space planning component of PG-18-9 is based on the Space Planning Concept 
Matrix (SPCM) which lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and assigns room 
quantity (Q) and area (NSF) for a series of ranges corresponding to the smallest to the 
largest department for this service in the VA healthcare system in incremental size; each 
range corresponds to a workload parameter which determines the number and area of 
each directly workload-driven room. The rest of the rooms in the range i.e., waiting, 
storage, staff workstations, etc. are determined by ratios to the resulting number of or 
NSF of the workload-driven rooms. 
D. Sections 4 and 5 of these space planning standards as well as the PG-18-5 standard are 
implemented in the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) and hosted at the 
MAX.gov website so planners working on VA Construction projects can develop single or 
multi-department projects based on these PG-18-9- and the PG-18-5 standards. Output 
from SEPS is through Space and Contents Reports; the Space Report is the Program for 
Design (PFD), the Content Report is the Project Room Contents (PRC). Inclusion of a 
Functional Area as well as Room quantity (Q) and determination of the room area (NSF) 
in the PFD is based on the projected Workload input which triggers calculations included 
in the Room Criteria Statements (RCSs). The RCSs are placed immediately after each 
room name, room code and baseline area (NSF). The PRC list the medical equipment, 
furniture and fixtures associated to each Room Code in the project. The PFD & PRC are 
the baseline requirements for the planning phase of a VA project based on a site’s 
projected workload for the target planning year. This chapter’s corresponding PG-18-12, 
Design Guide -if available- is intended for use during the design phase of the project.

204 – Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology (ASLP) Service 
  9 of 32 
E. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Audiology 
and Speech-Language Pathology Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as the 
basis for this chapter. The Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology SPCM lists all the 
spaces a VA Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology site would require; the quantity 
and NSF for each room is calculated based on the Audiology and Speech-Language 
Pathology projected workload or number of FTE positions authorized. The SPCM is 
organized in 36 ranges as follows: 
1. Ranges 1 to 4: AUD: Hearing Aid Repair between 960 and 19,200 annual repair Clinic 
Stops (in increments of 4,800) 
2. Ranges 5 to 12: AUD: Audiometric Examination (Control Room incorporated) 
between 640 and 25,600 annual Clinic Stops (in increments of 3,200) 
3. Ranges 13 to 20: AUD: Audiometric Examination (separate Control Room) between 
640 and 25,600 annual Clinic Stops (in increments of 3,200) 
4. Ranges 21 to 28: AUD: Hearing Aid Fitting and Assessment Procedures between 430 
and 17,064 annual Clinic Stops (in increments of 2,133) 
5. Ranges 29 to 30: AUD: Cerumen Procedures between 960 and 9,600 annual Clinic 
Stops (in increments of 4,800) 
6. Ranges 31 to 32: AUD: Electrophysiology Procedures between 640 and 6,400 annual 
Clinic Stops (in increments of 3,200) 
7. Ranges 33 to 34: SLP: Voice Function Procedures between 295 and 2,954 annual 
Clinic Stops (in increments of 1,477) 
8. Ranges 35 to 36: SLP: Swallow Function Procedures between 137 and 1,372 annual 
Clinic Stops (in increments of 686) 
All current VA Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology sites are covered, the upper 
ranges are calculated for future facilities in case a higher projected workload or FTE 
positions authorized than those at the present time for Audiology and Speech-Language 
Pathology. 
F. The SPCM metrics are translated into one (or more) Room Criteria Statement (RCS) for 
each room in Section 5 of this document. The SPCM Planning Range, the maximum 
number of directly workload-driven exam rooms (all types) in this document is 36. If a 
project shall require provision of workload driven rooms above the maximum range 
value refer to CFM for guidance. Rooms in this space planning document are organized 
in 7 Functional Areas (FAs). 
Based on its intended function, each room / space is assigned a: 
1. Room Name (RN), 
2. Room Code (RC), 
3. Room Area, the Net Square Feet (NSF) and its corresponding “soft metric” Net 
Square Meters (NSM), 
4. Unique Room Criteria Statement(s) (RCSs) correlated to answers to Input Data 
Statements (IDSs), and 
5. Room Comment as needed.

G. The Room Codes included in this chapter stem from the VA Room Family. A unique 
support space, that may have variable area, is assigned a unique Room Code and adopts 
the square footage, as needed, correlated to the room contents assigned which in turn 
correspond to the range for those rooms. A unique clinical space or a direct clinical 
support room, i.e., control room, system components room, etc. typically does not 
feature variable NSF. Patient Care room names for rooms unique to this chapter end in 
“, ASLP SVC”. Patient Care Support room names end in “, Bldg Sprt”, “Clncl Sprt”, “Stff 
Sprt”, or “, Vet Sprt”, correlating to Building, Clinical, Staff or Veteran Support room 
families. 
H. Section 5, Sub-Section H lists the SEPS Importer Shortcuts used for implementation of 
Sections 4 & 5 in SEPS. These shortcuts are inserted into the Room Criteria Statement 
(RCS) for each room which upon upload into the Space and Equipment Planning System 
(SEPS) allowing planners developing VA healthcare projects to determine quantity and 
square footage of each room by performing mathematical or logical calculations. 
Shortcuts refer Input Data Statements (IDSs), Rooms or calculation parameters 
stemming from the SPCM. 
I. SEPS is accessible to government healthcare planners and private sector consultants 
working on VA HC projects during their Period of Performance (PoP) through the 
MAX.gov website; government provided Training is a requisite for access. 
J. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross factor (NTDG) factor of 1.50 for Audiology 
and Speech-Language Pathology and a Building Gross factor of 1.35 in the space 
calculation to generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building 
Gross Square Feet (BGSF) respectively for the project based on the aggregate resulting 
Net Square Feet (NSF) for each range. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the 
NTDG factor is fixed. 
K. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-5 Equipment Guidelist for the Room Content 
assignment for each room during the planning phase of a project. 
L. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-12: Design Guide, if available, during the 
planning and design phases of a project. Not all PG-18-9 clinical chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 document, please refer to the VA-TIL. 
M. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website.

6 PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. General 
1. Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology (ASPS) shall be collocated in a medical 
center or outpatient clinic with dedicated space planned to accommodate the 
specialized functional requirements of the services. 
2. Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology shall be located to facilitate wayfinding 
via intuitive visual cues and clear, visible, barrier free signage. Proximity to an 
entrance or vertical transportation is recommended to minimize walking distances 
for patients and family members who may have a variety of physical and cognitive 
disabilities. 
3. There are direct service relationships between Audiology and Speech-Language 
Pathology Service, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Service, and ENT. These 
services should be near each other. 
4. There is a direct service relationship between Speech-Language Pathology and 
Radiology. Locate close to each other, or provide clear, intuitive wayfinding between 
the two departments.  
5. At VA Medical Centers, there is a direct service relationship between Audiology and 
Speech-Language Pathology and inpatient, and residential services (including 
Intensive Care, Spinal Cord Injury Unit, and Community Living Center), as well as the 
Emergency Department. Proximity to vertical transportation to facilitate workflow, 
the occasional movement of beds and gurneys to ASPS, and staff access to these 
departments, if on a different level, is recommended. 
6. There is a significant service relationship between Speech-Language Pathology and 
Sterile Processing Service (SPS). Proximity to vertical transportation to facilitate 
workflow, if SPS is on a different level, is recommended. 
7. Compatible outpatient specialty service adjacencies include the Eye and Dental 
Clinics.  
8. Every precaution shall be taken to locate Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology 
away from intrusive noises and electromagnetic radiation sources. Refer to the 
Design Guide for additional details.  
9. Windows with control for daylight and privacy are beneficial for patients and staff to 
alleviate stress associated with some diagnostics in the department. They may be 
incorporated, where possible in the reception, patient clinic, and 
staff/administrative functional areas. Refer to additional considerations in the 
following paragraphs. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
204 – Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology (ASLP) Service 
  25 of 32 
10. Refer to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management Technical Information Library (www.cfm.va.gov/til/) for additional 
technical criteria. 
B. Reception Area 
1. Provide sufficient waiting and seating to accommodate scheduled and walk-in 
patients and their family member(s) immediately adjacent to the clinical area.  
Configure in such a way to permit direct visualization of patients by receptionist(s) 
and to facilitate communication with patients with various disabilities, including 
hearing and visual impairments.  
2. The waiting area shall be a comfortable, healing environment with design features 
and positive distractions that minimize stress. Design considerations include, color 
scheme, material selection, ambient lighting, “zoning” of activities (in large waiting 
areas), seating configuration, views to the outside, and artwork. The waiting area 
shall accommodate bariatric seating and wheelchairs/scooters.  
3. The waiting area shall have access to vending or the Canteen Service (such as Café), 
nearby, but not adjacent, for the convenience of patients, family members, and staff 
since some procedures take more than an hour. 
4. If Speech-Language Pathology patient areas cannot be collocated with Audiology, a 
dedicated reception/waiting area and associated spaces shall be provided adjacent 
to the Speech-Language Pathology clinic. 
C. Audiology Clinic Patient Area 
Depending on the size of the clinic and types of procedures authorized, Audiology 
patient care spaces may be organized by function/activity as follows: 
• Hearing Assessment/Hearing Aid Programming/Fitting Zone: rooms accommodate 
first time and established patient encounters to assess hearing, perform 
Compensation & Pension exams (including Medical Testimony), to program/fit 
hearing aids, and consultation with patients and family members. Rooms in this area 
require a high level of sound attenuation, and separation from electromagnetic 
radiation sources. Encounters in these rooms have some of the longest durations in 
the clinic. Rooms in this area include: 
- Rehabilitation / Counseling Room 
- Single and / or Double Audiometric Examination 
- Audiometric Programming / Fitting Room 
• Audiology Treatment and Support Zone: rooms accommodate routine treatments, 
such as hearing aid repairs and cerumen removal, which average less than 30 
minutes. Rooms in this area include: 
- Hearing Aid Repair Room 
- Cerumen Management Room 
The Hearing Aid Lab, a Support Area room, shall be located adjacent to these rooms.  
The Hearing Aid Processing Room should be located close to these rooms and the 
Audiometric Programming/Fitting Room. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
204 – Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology (ASLP) Service 
  26 of 32 
• Balance Testing and Support Zone: rooms in this area accommodate specialized 
Audiology procedures for the diagnosis and treatment of balance disorders. Rooms 
in this area include: 
- Posturography Room 
- Vestibulography Room 
- Rotary Chair Room 
The Electrophysiology Room shall be located adjacent to these rooms since 
diagnostics in the room are most closely associated with the balance testing. Not 
every Audiology clinic will have balance testing/treatment rooms; some may only 
have one room or accommodate multiple diagnostics/treatments in a single room 
(such as Rotary Chair and VNG together). 
The Telehealth Room, if authorized, is a patient care space which does not require 
access by patients; it should be in a quiet area close to the Staff and Administrative 
Area. 
The Telehealth Exam Room, if authorized is a patient care space which requires access 
by patients; it should be in the Audiology Clinic Area but requires sound attenuation 
considerations. 
Prefabricated sound booths shall be recessed into pits (structural slab depression) to 
provide unencumbered access. If not feasible, floors must be raised to eliminate sills. 
Prefabricated sound booths require additional facility considerations including sufficient 
floor-to-floor height to accommodate mechanical and electrical systems above the 
booth, clearances around the enclosure, and special connections to building mechanical, 
plumbing (sprinkler) and electrical systems.  
Exterior windows are beneficial and may be provided in the Rehabilitation/Counseling 
and Audiometric Programming/Fitting Rooms. Windows are to be avoided in the 
balance testing rooms (since some diagnostics require complete darkness). Windows 
are not recommended in the general Audiology treatment rooms but may be provided if 
coordinated with equipment placement.  Window treatments or other architectural 
devices are required to maintain privacy and to control daylight and glare. 
A Patient Toilet must be near the Audiology Patient Care Area. An additional Patient 
Toilet is required if balance testing is performed.  
Finishes must balance sound attenuation requirements with infection control and other 
considerations, such as patient mobility. 
• Carpet tile may be used in Rehabilitation/Counseling, Audiometric Examination, and 
Audiometric Programming/Fitting Rooms. Non-porous, easily cleanable flooring is to 
be used in other Audiology patient care and support spaces. 
D. Speech-Language Pathology Clinic Patient Care Area 
Depending on the size of the clinic and types of procedures authorized, SpeechLanguage
Pathology patient care spaces may be organized by function/activity as 
follows: 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
204 – Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology (ASLP) Service 
  27 of 32 
• Speech Evaluation/Therapy Zone: Rooms accommodate the non-instrumental 
evaluation and treatment of Speech-Language, and cognitive disorders. Rooms in 
this area should be located close to the clinic entry and include: 
- Speech Exam Rooms 
- Assistive Technology Rooms 
• Procedure Zone: Rooms accommodate the instrumental evaluation of voice and 
swallowing disorders. Rooms in this area include: 
- Voice Treatment Room 
- Procedure Room 
These rooms require direct or proximity to Support Area functions, including Soiled 
Utility and Clean Supply Rooms. 
Exterior windows are beneficial and may be provided in the Office/Treatment Room. 
Windows are to be avoided in the Special Procedure and Voice Treatment Rooms.  
Windows are not recommended in the Assistive Technology Room but may be provided 
if coordinated with equipment and furniture placement. Window treatments or other 
architectural devices are required to maintain privacy and to control daylight and glare. 
Finishes must balance sound attenuation requirements with infection control and other 
considerations, such as patient mobility. 
• Carpet tile may be used in the Office/Treatment Room. 
• Non-porous, easily cleanable flooring is required in the Voice Treatment and 
Procedure Rooms; carpet tile is not permitted in these spaces. Alternative strategies 
such as increasing the STC rating of partitions and higher NRC-rated ceiling system 
will need to be employed to maintain speech privacy and contain noise generated in 
these rooms. 
E. Support Area 
This area includes both specialized and standard clinical support spaces. 
Depending on the size of the clinic, common rooms, such as Clean Supply and Soiled 
Utility Rooms, may be shared, or dedicated to the unique requirements of each service. 
• Clean Supply and Soiled Utility Rooms associated with Speech-Language Pathology 
procedure rooms (Special Procedure and Voice Treatment) have unique 
requirements and should be located directly adjacent to or very close to the 
procedure rooms. 
• The Assistive Technology Room may need additional equipment storage space. 
The Hearing Aid Lab and Hearing Aid Processing Room shall be located adjacent to 
Audiology Patient Care Rooms. 
• The Hearing Aid Lab location must consider acoustical separation and sound 
attenuation relative to adjacent spaces to contain noise. 
Depending on the size of the clinic, it is recommended to locate access to clinical 
support rooms via a separate “off stage” staff corridor. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022

F. Staff and Administrative Area 
The quantity and type of staff and administrative offices and support space will depend 
on the number of FTEs authorized. 
Locate staff and administrative areas adjacent to clinical areas to minimize staff walking 
distances. 
• It is recommended to locate access to these spaces via a separate “off stage” staff 
corridor. 
The Break Room, Conference Room, Locker Alcove and Staff Toilet shall be shared 
between Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology, however if Audiology and SpeechLanguage
Pathology are not collocated, additional space must be planned to 
accommodate these functions adjacent to each clinical area. 
Exterior windows are beneficial and may be provided in the Offices, Break Room, and 
Conference Room. Window treatments or other architectural devices are required to 
maintain privacy and to control daylight and glare. 
G. Education Area 
Locate education space adjacent to the Staff and Administration Area for ease of staff 
access. 
The Resident/Fellow Collaboration Room may be shared by Audiology and SpeechLanguage
Pathology residents and trainees. 
The size of the Resident Collaboration Room will depend upon the number of 
anticipated resident/trainee workstations to be accommodated and shall include space 
for a small conference table/collaboration area. 
Exterior windows are beneficial and may be provided in the Resident/Fellow 
Collaboration Room. Window treatments or other architectural devices are required to 
maintain privacy and to control daylight and glare.

Veterans enrolled in the VA Healthcare system; as well as serve VA employees, volunteers, 
and visitors to VA facilities. 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Day Shift Factor: The percentage of employees who will be on site for the Peak Volume 
Single Meal. Number should exclude employees who are on vacation, sick leave or traveling. 
If no value is given, a default value of 0.75 will be used. 
Dine in Rate: The estimated percentage of employees who obtain a meal in the Canteen 
Cafeteria and use the dining room as opposed to carryout. The default value for the Dine in

Participation Factor: The projected percentage of the available employees and visitors that 
will participate in the Food Court. This factor can vary from 35% to 75% depending on the 
quality of the food and service, the availability of alternative dining facilities, the meal price 
point compared to commercial dining facilities, length of employee meal period, and the 
proximity of the cafeteria in relationship to its customers. The Participation Factor may be 
based on historical data of an existing cafeteria, or projected data based on similar facilities 
in the area. If no value is given, a default value of 50% for lunch and 15% for breakfast will 
be used. 
Peak Half Hour Factor: Based on industry standards and historical data, 36% of cafeteria 
customers dine in the peak half-hour of business. 
Peak Volume Single Meal: The maximum projected number of meals served in the Canteen 
Cafeteria during a single meal period (breakfast or lunch or dinner). 
Peak Volume Meals per Day: The maximum projected number of meals served in the 
Cafeteria during a single day (breakfast and lunch and dinner). 
Seating Inefficiency Factor: A factor that accounts for the fact that all seats at one dining 
table are not utilized. Based on industry standards and historical data, this factor is 0.85. 
Serving Area: Area of the Food Court associated with customer service including food shops, 
serving counters, display equipment, customer circulation space and cashier stations. 
State Licensing Agency (SLA): The United States Department of Education has been 
designated as the State Licensing Agency for implementation of the Act commonly known

areas: Retail Store, Optical Shop, Barber and Beauty Shop, Vendor Concessions, Food Court, 
Coffee Shop and Vending Area. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS.

Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs.

5 of 29 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM.

VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Veterans 
Canteen Service (VCS) Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as a basis for 
this chapter. The VCS-SPCM lists all the values included in each range a VA site would 
require; the quantity and NSF for each room is calculated based on the projected 
number of FTE positions. The VCS-SPCM is organized in 10 ranges, each range 
represents an increment of 500 FTEs -the driver for this chapter- correlated to the 
number of daily peak volume meal. The ranges cover between 100 and 5,000 FTEs or 
between 315 to 3,170 daily peak volume meals with the intent to cover all current and 
future VA VCS sites. 
B. The Quantity (Q) and area (NSF) values developed in the SPCM are reflected in the 
Room Criteria Statements, placed immediately below each room name, room code and 
NSF/NSM, for each room in Section 5 of this document. The number of FTE positions 
driver is included in the Input Data Statement in Section 4. Both Sections are 
implemented in the Space Planning and Equipment System (SEPS) software accessible 
through the MAX.gov website. Planners programming a VA VCS project shall develop a 
baseline Program for Design (PFD) in SEPS. 
C. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross factor (NTDG) factor of 1.20 for VCS 
projects and a Building Gross (BGS) factor of 1.35 to the aggregate Department Gross 
Square Feet (DGSF) of all the departments included in the project to generate the 
Building Gross Square Feet (BGSF). Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the 
NTDG factor is fixed.

K. SEPS IMPORTER SHORTCUTS 
The following shortcuts are used in the Room Criteria Statements in the Veteran 
Canteen Service (VCS) Functional Areas. These shortcuts are used during upload of this 
document into the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) software during 
implementation of the space planning parameters contained herewith to allow for 
mathematical or logical calculations to be performed. Input Data Statements (IDSs), 
Rooms or a partial calculation formula can have a shortcut. 
1. FTE positions authorized for this facility: [How many FTE positions in total are 
authorized for this facility?] 
6 PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. The Chief, Canteen Service must be notified if a joint VCS / DoD operation is being 
considered. 
B. Veterans Canteen Services are a major traffic generator in the Medical Center and 
therefore should be located on the main floor and be easily accessible from the 
passenger elevators. 
C. The customer areas, Retail Store, entry to the Food Court, Vending, and the Barber and 
Beauty shop, shall have direct access from a main corridor. 
D. On all new construction projects, the VCS Food Court will be combined with NFS. In 
remodels, the two areas should be collocated, when possible. 
E. All areas must comply with VA’s Barrier Free Design Guide PG-18-13 and ADAAG, 
current accepted version. 
F. Automatic doors should be provided to aid access of non-ambulatory patients. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
206 – Veterans Canteen Service (VCS) 
26 of 29 
G. Emergency power shall be provided for Canteen Retail Stores and Food Court. 
H. Exhaust hoods shall be located, where possible, to avoid or minimize horizontal duct 
runs. 
I. Walk-in refrigerator and freezer floors shall be constructed in a recess in the slab, where 
possible. 
J. The VCS Food Court will offer meals on single-use disposable wares. Permanent dishes 
and utensils may be used, if authorized. 
K. Permanent and disposable cafeteria trays will be offered. 
L. Centralized cashier stations at the exit point of the Food Court will be used. 
M. Employees have approximately 30 minutes for lunch, the peak meal. 
N. Employees are permitted to take food back to their offices / workspaces. 
O. Randolph-Sheppard requirements 
1. The Randolph-Sheppard (R-S) Act requires the Secretary of the Department of 
Education (DOED) to promulgate regulations establishing a national program to 
place visually impaired vendors in vending operations (including vending machines) 
within facilities owned by the Federal government. Pursuant to the Act, the DOED 
Secretary must also designate an agency in each state to license blind vendors for 
facilities on Federal properties. 20 U.S.C. Section 107a(a)(5). These are called state 
licensing agencies (SLAs). Under the Act, Federal agencies have a duty to extend to 
the SLAs an opportunity to seek space for blind vendors to conduct business. 
Complying with the Act results, at some VHA facilities, in allowing blind vendors to 
compete with the Veterans Canteen Service. 
2. The R-S regulations prohibit building, acquiring or substantially altering facilities that 
meet specified size and patronage requirements unless it is determined that the 
design includes a satisfactory site or sites for a blind vendor. 34 C.F.R. Sections 
395.31(a) and (b). The regulatory provisions do not apply when fewer than 100 
Federal Government employees are or will be located during normal working hours 
in the building to be acquired or otherwise occupied or when such building contains 
less than 15,000 square feet of interior space to be used for Federal Government 
purposes in the case of buildings in which services are to be provided to the public. 
34 C.F.R. Section 395.31(d). See VA Directive 7632 attached (reissued May 15, 2002). 
3. Responsibility for administering the R-S program has been assigned to the Chief 
Facilities Management Officer. Space negotiations and commitments, infrastructure 
modifications, and electrical and plumbing support are matters that develop 
between local facility management and the SLA. By regulation, the permit issued to 
the SLA stipulates that agencies are responsible for cleaning, maintaining and 
repairing the space surrounding the vending facility, and that the vendors are 
responsible for sanitation, maintenance, and other aspects of managing the vending 
equipment. At most sites where R-S permits will be sought, the Veterans Canteen

Service (VCS) may already be providing or seeking to provide retail services, and 
coordination between local management and local Canteen Service officials is 
essential. 
P. Refer to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management Technical Information Library (www.cfm.va.gov/til/) for additional 
technical criteria.

1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines Space Planning Criteria for Chaplain Service. 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning system (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
208 – Chaplain Service 
3 of 10 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022

Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic 
encounters etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload 
applied to departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room 
requirements by modality. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Chaplain 
Service Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as a basis for this chapter. The 
SPCM lists all the spaces a VA site would require; the quantity and NSF for each room is 
calculated based on the projected number of people attending Service. The Chaplain 
Service is organized in 5 ranges, each range represents an increment of 10 people 
attending Service -the driver for this chapter. The ranges cover between 5 and 60 
Service attendees with the intent to cover all current and future VA Chaplain Service 
sites. 
B. The Quantity (Q) and area (NSF) values developed in the SPCM are reflected in the 
Room Criteria Statements, placed immediately below each room name, room code and 
NSF/NSM, for each room in Section 5 of this document. The number of people attending 
Service driver as well as the number of FTE positions authorized is included in the Input 
Data Statement in Section 4. Both Sections are implemented in the Space Planning and 
Equipment System (SEPS) software accessible through the MAX.gov website. Planners 
programming a VA Chaplain Service project shall develop a baseline Program for Design 
(PFD) in SEPS. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
208 – Chaplain Service 
5 of 10 
C. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross factor (NTDG) factor of 1.30 for Chaplain 
Service projects and a Building Gross (BGS) factor of 1.35 to the aggregate Department 
Gross Square Feet (DGSF) of all the departments included in the project to generate the 
Building Gross Square Feet (BGSF). Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the 
NTDG factor is fixed. 
D. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website.

6 PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. The priority in the placement of Chaplains’ workstations is the proximity to patient 
care areas so that Chaplains may provide pastoral care and counseling. When 
feasible, Chaplain Staff and administrative space should be close to the chapel / 
worship space. 
B. The spaces of Functional Area 1 should be located with convenient access from the 
Medical Center Main Lobby and public circulation. 
C. Refer to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management Technical Information Library (www.cfm.va.gov/til/) for additional 
technical criteria.

1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines Space Planning Criteria for Chapter 210: Cardiology Service, noninvasive
services. It applies to all medical facilities in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Blood Gas Analysis: A test which analyzes arterial blood for oxygen, carbon dioxide, and 
bicarbonate content in addition to blood pH. It is used to test the effectiveness of 
respiration. 
Cardiac Stress Test: A cardiac stress test is a medical test performed to evaluate the ability 
for arterial blood flow to the myocardium (heart muscle) to increase during the stress of 
physical exercise, compared to blood flow while at rest. As an exercise test, results also 
reflect overall physical fitness. This test is ordered as a screening procedure for heart 
disease. It takes approximately 30 minutes, usually including 6-9 minutes of treadmill 
walking. Electrodes are placed on the chest so that the EKG is monitored during the entire 
exam, while the physician monitors the patient’s blood pressure. 
Cardiac Stress Test – Nuclear: This test follows the same procedure as the Cardiac Stress 
Test, with the addition of a nuclear scan. To scan the heart with a nuclear camera, a small 
amount of nuclear substance is injected into the patient, which acts as a tracer. This allows 
the tracking of blood cells as they circulate from the arteries to the heart muscle. Nuclear 
images are taken with a nuclear medicine camera after the exercise phase as well as at rest 
for comparison. 
Cardiology: The study of the heart and its functions. 
Echocardiogram (ECHO): A diagnostic test which uses ultrasound waves to make images of 
the heart chambers, valves, and surrounding structures. It can measure cardiac output and 
is a sensitive test for pericarditis and inflammation around the heart. 
Electrocardiogram (EKG): A test that records the electrical activity of the heart, shows 
abnormal rhythms (arrhythmias or dysrhythmias), and detects heart muscle damage. 
Holter Monitor: A device which measures the heart rhythm during a 24 hour period of time 
while the patient records their symptoms and activities in a diary. A small portable EKG 
device is worn by the patient. After the test is complete, a correlation is made between the 
symptoms (or activities) recorded and the EKG pattern that was obtained simultaneously. 
Non-Invasive Cardiology: Procedures that do not penetrate the skin or invade the body, 
except for minor needle punctures. Non-Invasive procedures include EKG, Holter 
Monitoring, Echocardiography, Vascular Testing, Ultrasound, and Nuclear Cardiography. 
Pacemaker Implants: An “artificial pacemaker” is a small, battery-operated device that helps 
the heart beat in a regular rhythm. Some devices are permanent (internal) and some are 
temporary (external). 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
210 –Cardiology Service 
3 of 22 
Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS): The digital capture, transfer, and 
storage of diagnostic images. A PACS system consists of: workstations for interpretation, 
image/data producing modalities, a web server for distribution, printers for file records, 
image servers for information transfer and holding, and an archive of off-line information. A 
computer network is needed to support digital imaging devices. 
Provider: An individual who examines, diagnoses, treats, prescribes medication and 
manages the care of patients within his or her scope of practice as established by the 
governing body of a healthcare organization. 
Tilt Table Test: A test which involves placing the patient on a table with a foot-support. The 
table is tilted in various directions and the blood pressure and pulse are measured and 
symptoms are recorded with the patient in diverse positions. 
Ultrasound: High frequency sound waves which are utilized to determine the size and shape 
of organs based on the differential rates of reflection. In addition, images can be observed 
in real time to reveal motion, and can include coloration of arterial and venous blood flow. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Accessible: A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with provisions outlined 
in the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA). 
Architectural Barriers Act (ABA): A set of standards developed to ensure that all buildings 
financed with federal funds are designed and constructed to be fully accessible to everyone. 
This law requires all construction, renovation, or leasing of sites, facilities, buildings, and 
other elements, financed with federal funds, to comply with the Architectural Barriers Act 
Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). The ABAAS replaces the Uniform Federal Accessibility 
Standards (UFAS). 
Average Length of Encounter (ALoE): Averaged length of time, in minutes, a patient spends 
in an Exam / Treatment Room interacting with a provider and the clinical support team. It is 
accounted from room “set-up” to “clean-up” by staff. This metric is used to determine the 
number of annual patient / provider encounters that take place in an Exam / Treatment 
Room which, in turn, is used to calculate the number of Exam / Treatment Rooms needed in 
a facility based on projected annual workload. The ALoE is determined with VHA SME input 
during a PG-18-9 clinical chapter revision / update. 
Average Length of Stay (ALoS): The average number of days a patient Veteran stays in an 
inpatient care unit. The ALoS is used to calculate the number of patient bedrooms for a 
specialty by dividing the site’s projected workload by the ALoS. 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022

Clinic Stop: Per these criteria, a clinic stop is the workload unit of measure for space 
planning. Clinic Stops are codified by VSSC, when applicable, they are referenced by number 
in the calculation of workload driven patient care spaces in this document. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Encounter: An interaction between a patient Veteran and a VA provider or providers in an 
Exam Room / Treatment Room / Consultation Room / Procedure Room, spaces where a 
patient Veteran received clinical care. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Patient Unique: (or Unique Patient), A Veteran patient counted as a unique in each division 
from which they receive care. Patient Uniques are included in the Registry for a VA Medical 
Center. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard.

5 of 22 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs.  
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Provider: An individual who examines, diagnoses, treats, prescribes medication, and 
manages the care of patients within his or her scope of practice as established by the 
governing body of a healthcare organization. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
Room Efficiency Factor: A factor that provides flexibility in the utilization of a room to 
account for patient delays, scheduling conflicts, and equipment maintenance. Common 
factors are in the 75% to 85% range. A room with 80% room efficiency provides a buffer to 
assume that this room would be available 20% of the time beyond the planned operational 
practices for this room. This factor may be adjusted based on the actual and/or anticipated 
operations and processes of the room/department at a particular facility. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022

6 of 22 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
Stop Code: A measure of workload including clinic stops forecasted by the Office of Policy 
and Planning (OPP) for all Strategic Planning Categories at Medical Center and Outpatient 
Clinic levels. 
Telehealth: The use of technology, such as computers and mobile devices, to manage 
healthcare remotely. It includes a variety of health care services, including but not limited to 
online support groups, online health information and self-management tools, email and 
online communication with health care providers, remote monitoring of vital signs, video, 
or online doctor visits. Depending on the concept of operations for this space, it may be 
equipped as an exam room or as a consult room with video/camera capability. 
Utilization Rate: A factor used in the calculation of a directly workload-driven room 
throughput. It represents, in a percent value, the room is idle based on the planning 
assumptions. For example, if a directly workload-driven room is available for use 8 hours a 
day, the Utilization Rate represents the assumed time it will be actually be used, an 85% 
utilization rate indicates, for planning purposes, the room will be used 6.8 hours a day. An 
additional directly workload-driven room will be provided in the calculation once the 
previous room has reached 100% utilization. The utilization Rate is embedded in the Room 
Throughput value calculated in Section 3 of this document.

VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
Workstation: Area outfitted with equipment and furnishings, typically allocated 56 NSF 
each. Managers and other staff with no direct reports as well as part-time, seasonal, and 
job-sharing staff may qualify for a workstation. Such environments are particularly 
conducive to team-oriented office groupings. These environments work best when they 
have access to conference and small group meeting spaces. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space planning criteria included in this Standard have been specifically developed for 
this Department / Service in a Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare facility based 
on established VHA policy and guidelines to define the scope of services provided for 
the veterans existing workload demand as well as that in the foreseeable future. Rooms 
and Functional Areas are provided based on research of clinical and non-clinical 
activities performed in this Department. 
B. Development / update of VA’s Program Guide (PG) standards is a research based effort 
executed with participation of VHA Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), VA-Construction and 
Facilities Management Office (CFM) professional staff and specialty consultants hired for 
the task. These space planning standards are based on current applicable VHA policies 
and guidelines, established and/or anticipated best practice standards, and latest 
medical technology developments. Workload metrics were tailored to satisfy current 
and anticipated veteran workload demand. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
210 –Cardiology Service 
8 of 22 
C. The space planning component of PG-18-9 is based on the Space Planning Concept 
Matrix (SPCM) which lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and assigns room 
quantity (Q) and area (NSF) for a series of ranges corresponding to the smallest to the 
largest department for this service in the VA healthcare system in incremental size; each 
range corresponds to a workload parameter which determines the number and area of 
each directly workload-driven room. The rest of the rooms in the range i.e., waiting, 
storage, staff workstations, etc. are determined by ratios to the resulting number of or 
NSF of the workload-driven rooms. 
D. Sections 4 and 5 of these space planning standards as well as the PG-18-5 standard are 
implemented in the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) and hosted at the 
MAX.gov website so planners working on VA Construction projects can develop single or 
multi-department projects based on these -PG-18-9- and the PG-18-5 standards. Output 
from SEPS is through Space and Contents Reports; the Space Report is the Program for 
Design (PFD), the Content Report is the Project Room Contents (PRC). Inclusion of a 
Functional Area as well as Room quantity (Q) and determination of the room area (NSF) 
in the PFD is based on the projected Workload input which triggers calculations included 
in the Room Criteria Statements (RCSs). The RCSs are placed immediately after each 
room name, room code and baseline area (NSF). The PRC list the medical equipment, 
furniture and fixtures associated to each Room Code in the project. The PFD & PRC are 
the baseline requirements for the planning phase of a VA project based on a site’s 
projected workload for the target planning year. This chapter’s corresponding PG-18-12, 
Design Guide -if available- is intended for use during the design phase of the project. 
E. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Cardiology 
Service Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as the basis for this chapter. 
The Cardiology Service SPCM lists all the spaces a VA Cardiology Service site would 
require; the quantity and NSF for each room is calculated based on the Cardiology 
Service projected workload. The SPCM is organized in 20 ranges as follows: 
1. Ranges 1 to 5: EKG Stop Code 107 between 1,440 and 24.000 annual clinic stops (in 
increments of 4,800) 
2. Ranges 6 to 10: Cardiology Stop Code 303 between 640 and 10.665 annual clinic 
stops (in increments of 2,133) 
3. Ranges 11 to 15: Pacemaker Stop Code 311 between 960 and 16.000 annual clinic 
stops (in increments of 3,200) 
4. Ranges 16 to 20: Cardiac Stress Stop Code 334 between 384 and 6.400 annual clinic 
stops (in increments of 1,280 
This way all current VA Cardiology Service sites are covered, the upper ranges are 
calculated for future facilities in case a higher projected workload or FTE positions 
authorized than those at the present time for Cardiology Service.

F. The SPCM metrics are translated into one (or more) Room Criteria Statement (RCS) for 
each room in Section 5 of this document. The SPCM Planning Range, the maximum 
number of directly workload-driven exam rooms -all specialties- in this document is 20. 
If a project shall require provision of workload driven rooms above the maximum range 
value) refer to CFM for guidance. Rooms in this space planning document are organized 
in 5 Functional Areas (FAs). 
G. Based on its intended function, each room / space is assigned a: 
1. Room Name (RN), 
2. Room Code (RC), 
3. Room Area, the Net Square Feet (NSF) and its corresponding “soft metric” Net 
Square Meters (NSM), 
4. Unique Room Criteria Statement(s) (RCSs) correlated to answers to Input Data 
Statements (IDSs), and 
5. Room Comment as needed. 
H. The Room Codes included in this chapter stem from the VA Room Family. A unique 
support space, that may have variable are, is assigned a unique Room Code and adopts 
the square footage, as needed, correlated to the room contents assigned which in turn 
correspond to the range for those rooms. A unique clinical space or a direct clinical 
support room, i.e., control room, system components room, etc. typically does not 
feature variable NSF. Patient Care room names for rooms unique to this chapter end in 
“, Cardio Svc”. Patient Care Support room names end in “, Bldg Sprt”, “Clncl Sprt”, “Stff 
Sprt”, or “, Vet Sprt”, correlating to Building, Clinical, Staff or Veteran Support room 
families. 
I. Section 5, Sub-Section F lists the SEPS Importer Shortcuts used for implementation of 
Sections 4 & 5 in SEPS. These shortcuts are inserted into the Room Criteria Statement 
(RCS) for each room which upon upload into the Space and Equipment Planning System 
(SEPS) allowing planners developing VA healthcare projects to determine quantity and 
square footage of each room by performing mathematical or logical calculations. 
Shortcuts refer Input Data Statements (IDSs), Rooms or calculation parameters 
stemming from the SPCM. 
J. SEPS is accessible to government healthcare planners and private sector consultants 
working on VA HC projects during their Period of Performance (PoP) through the 
MAX.gov website; government provided Training is a requisite for access. 
K. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross factor (NTDG) factor of 1.50 for 
Cardiology Service and a Building Gross factor of 1.35 in the space calculation to 
generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross Square Feet 
(BGSF) respectively for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet 
(NSF) for each range. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the NTDG factor is 
fixed. 
L. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-5 Equipment Guidelist for the Room Content 
assignment for each room during the planning phase of a project.

6 PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. Consider grouping clinician workspaces into a team room for multidisciplinary 
interaction. 
B. Separation of inpatient and outpatient traffic should be considered to the greatest 
extent possible. Provide Reception Check-in for outpatient separate from inpatient 
circulation when both patient types utilize the same departmental facilities. 
C. Standardization of rooms and modular design should be considered to allow flexibility to 
adapt to new technologies and respond to changes in patient volumes. 
D. Connection to ancillary services, such as lab and pharmacy, should be considered. 
E. The waiting room should be connected to the patient entrance corridor and be under 
the visual control of Reception / Check-in. This space can be shared between adjacent 
services where appropriate. 
F. Design should accommodate patient privacy and confidentiality in all areas, and in 
reception and patient care areas in particular. This includes visual and auditory 
considerations. 
G. Where possible, the department should be configured to limit the mix of patient and 
service functions, and to maintain clear separation of clean and dirty functions to avoid 
cross contamination. For example, Clean and Soiled Utility rooms can be located at 
alternate ends of a department. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
210 –Cardiology Service 
20 of 22 
H. Corridors should be designed to a minimum of 8 feet clear width to accommodate 
passage of equipment or beds and two stretchers and/or wheelchairs. In non-patient 
areas and outpatient clinical spaces, corridors may be a minimum of 5 feet in clear 
width. 
I. Administration and support areas should be located and designed to maximize staff and 
space efficiency, and reduce staff travel distances. 
J. Plan for locating high volume services closer to patient waiting or building access points 
to decrease patient travel time/distance and increase staff responsiveness. Services with 
longer duration procedure times or low volume generation can be less centrally located. 
K. Sharing of patient and staff support areas among adjacent services should be 
considered for efficient utilization of staff. For example, centralized check-in/check-out 
can reduce the total number of FTE’s required to provide this function over multiple 
service lines. 
L. During design, NSF for Staff Lounge and Lockers may be combined with an adjacent 
department(s). 
M. Verify room sizes and equipment layouts with equipment vendors prior to finalizing 
room layouts. 
N. Refer to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management Technical Information Library (www.cfm.va.gov/til/) for additional 
technical criteria. 
O. Refer to Design Guide for Cardiovascular Laboratory Service for a detailed discussion of 
functional and design considerations.

1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines Space Planning Criteria for Chapter 212: Pulmonary Medicine 
Service. It applies to all medical facilities in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
2 DEFINITIONS 
Blood Gas Analysis: A test which analyzes arterial blood for oxygen, carbon dioxide and 
bicarbonate content in addition to blood pH. It is used to test the effectiveness of 
respiration.
Bronchoscopy: A procedure that involves placement of a viewing instrument into the 
trachea (windpipe) and bronchi (airways) to diagnose or treat lung and airway problems. 
This procedure is typically performed to investigate abnormal chest x-rays, to collect biopsy 
bronchial or lung secretions, or to help diagnose and evaluate upper respiratory issues.
Healthcare Planning Module: Methodology used to create a VISN Strategic Plan which 
defines how and where high-cost services should be delivered in each market.
Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS): The digital capture, transfer, and 
storage of diagnostic images. A PACS system consists of: workstations for interpretation, 
image/data producing modalities, a web server for distribution, printers for file records, 
image servers for information transfer and holding, and an archive of off-line information. A 
computer network is needed to support digital imaging devices.
Polysomnography / Sleep Study: The collective process of monitoring and recording 
physiologic data during sleep.
Pulmonary Medicine: The branch of medicine that deals with the causes, diagnoses, 
prevention, and treatment of diseases affecting the lungs.
Pulmonary Function Test (PFT): Procedure used for measuring how well the lungs are 
working. The most common tests measure the ability of lungs to move air into and out of 
the lung.
Respiratory Therapy (RT): The treatment or management of acute and chronic breathing 
disorders, using respirators, supplemental oxygen, mechanical or noninvasive ventilation, or 
the administration of medication in aerosol form, including exercises and treatments that 
help patients recover lung function, such as after surgery.
Spirometry: Measurement of volume of air inhaled or exhaled by the lung.
Space Planning / SEPS
Accessible: A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with provisions outlined 
in the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA).

Architectural Barriers Act (ABA): A set of standards developed to ensure that all buildings 
financed with federal funds are designed and constructed to be fully accessible to everyone. 
This law requires all construction, renovation, or leasing of sites, facilities, buildings, and 
other elements, financed with federal funds, to comply with the Architectural Barriers Act 
Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). The ABAAS replaces the Uniform Federal Accessibility 
Standards (UFAS).
Average Length of Encounter (ALoE): Averaged length of time, in minutes, a patient spends 
in an Exam / Treatment Room interacting with a provider and the clinical support team. It is 
accounted from room “set-up” to “clean-up” by staff. This metric is used to determine the 
number of annual patient / provider encounters that take place in an Exam / Treatment 
Room which, in turn, is used to calculate the number of Exam / Treatment Rooms needed in 
a facility based on projected annual workload. The ALoE is determined with VHA SME input 
during a PG-18-9 clinical chapter revision / update.
Average Length of Stay (ALoS): The average number of days a patient Veteran stays in an 
inpatient care unit. The ALoS is used to calculate the number of patient bedrooms for a 
specialty by dividing the site’s projected workload by the ALoS.
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS.
Clinic Stop: Per these criteria, a clinic stop is the workload unit of measure for space 
planning. Clinic Stops are codified by VSSC, when applicable, they are referenced by number 
in the calculation of workload driven patient care spaces in this document.
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area.
Encounter: An interaction between a patient Veteran and a VA provider or providers in an 
Exam Room / Treatment Room / Consultation Room / Procedure Room, spaces where a 
patient Veteran received clinical care.
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week).
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department.

assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions.
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS).
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table.
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries.
Patient Unique: (or Unique Patient), A Veteran patient counted as a unique in each division 
from which they receive care. Patient Uniques are included in the Registry for a VA Medical 
Center.
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard.
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature.
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter.

Provider: An individual who examines, diagnoses, treats, prescribes medication, and 
manages the care of patients within his or her scope of practice as established by the 
governing body of a healthcare organization.
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF).
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects.
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project.
Room Efficiency Factor: A factor that provides flexibility in the utilization of a room to 
account for patient delays, scheduling conflicts, and equipment maintenance. Common 
factors are in the 75% to 85% range. A room with 80% room efficiency provides a buffer to 
assume that this room would be available 20% of the time beyond the planned operational 
practices for this room. This factor may be adjusted based on the actual and/or anticipated 
operations and processes of the room/department at a particular facility.
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions.
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section.
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM.
Stop Code: A measure of workload including clinic stops forecasted by the Office of Policy 
and Planning (OPP) for all Strategic Planning Categories at Medical Center and Outpatient 
Clinic levels.

Telehealth: The use of technology, such as computers and mobile devices, to manage 
healthcare remotely. It includes a variety of health care services, including but not limited to 
online support groups, online health information and self-management tools, email and 
online communication with health care providers, remote monitoring of vital signs, video, 
or online doctor visits. Depending on the concept of operations for this space, it may be 
equipped as an exam room or as a consult room with video/camera capability.
Utilization Rate: A factor used in the calculation of a directly workload-driven room 
throughput. It represents, in a percent value, the room is idle based on the planning 
assumptions. For example, if a directly workload-driven room is available for use 8 hours a 
day, the Utilization Rate represents the assumed time it will be actually be used, an 85% 
utilization rate indicates, for planning purposes, the room will be used 6.8 hours a day. An 
additional directly workload-driven room will be provided in the calculation once the 
previous room has reached 100% utilization. The utilization Rate is embedded in the Room 
Throughput value calculated in Section 3 of this document.
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room.
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality.
Workstation: Area outfitted with equipment and furnishings, typically allocated 56 NSF 
each. Managers and other staff with no direct reports as well as part-time, seasonal, and 
job-sharing staff may qualify for a workstation. Such environments are particularly 
conducive to team-oriented office groupings. These environments work best when they 
have access to conference and small group meeting spaces.

3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space planning criteria included in this Standard have been specifically developed for 
this Department / Service in a Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare facility based 
on established VHA policy and guidelines to define the scope of services provided for 
the existing workload demand as well as that in the foreseeable future. Rooms and 
Functional Areas are provided based on research of clinical and non-clinical activities 
performed in this Department.
B. Development / update of VA’s Program Guide (PG) standards is a research based effort 
executed with participation of VHA Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), VA-Construction and 
Facilities Management Office (CFM) professional staff and specialty consultants hired for 
the task. These space planning standards are based on current applicable VHA policies 
and guidelines, established and/or anticipated best practice standards, and latest 
medical technology developments. Workload metrics were tailored to satisfy current 
and anticipated veteran workload demand.
C. The space planning component of PG-18-9 is based on the Space Planning Concept 
Matrix (SPCM) which lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and assigns room 
quantity (Q) and area (NSF) for a series of ranges corresponding to the smallest to the 
largest department for this service in the VA healthcare system in incremental size; each 
range corresponds to a workload parameter which determines the number and area of 
each directly workload-driven room. The rest of the rooms in the range i.e., waiting, 
storage, staff workstations, etc. are determined by ratios to the resulting number of or 
NSF of the workload-driven rooms.
D. Sections 4 and 5 of these space planning standards as well as the PG-18-5 standard are 
implemented in the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) and hosted at the 
MAX.gov website so planners working on VA Construction projects can develop single or 
multi-department projects based on these PG-18-9- and the PG-18-5 standards. Output 
from SEPS is through Space and Contents Reports; the Space Report is the Program for 
Design (PFD), the Content Report is the Project Room Contents (PRC). Inclusion of a 
Functional Area as well as Room quantity (Q) and determination of the room area (NSF) 
in the PFD is based on the projected Workload input which triggers calculations included 
in the Room Criteria Statements (RCSs). The RCSs are placed immediately after each 
room name, room code and baseline area (NSF). The PRC list the medical equipment, 
furniture and fixtures associated to each Room Code in the project. The PFD & PRC are 
the baseline requirements for the planning phase of a VA project based on a site’s 
projected workload for the target planning year. This chapter’s corresponding PG-18-12, 
Design Guide -if available- is intended for use during the design phase of the project.

E. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Pulmonary 
Medicine Service Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as the basis for this 
chapter. The Pulmonary Medicine Service SPCM lists all the spaces a VA Pulmonary 
Medicine Service site would require; the quantity and NSF for each room is calculated 
based on the Pulmonary Medicine Service projected workload or number of FTE 
positions authorized. The SPCM is organized in 15 ranges as follows:
a. Ranges 1 to 5: Pulmonary Function Stop Code 104 between 960 and 16,000 annual 
clinic stops (in increments of 3,200)
b. Ranges 6 to 10: Bronchoscopy Stop Code 312 between 240 and 4,000 annual clinic 
stops (in increments of 800)
c. Ranges 11 to 15 Sleep Medicine Stop Code 349 between 60 and 1,000 annual clinic 
stops (in increments of 200)
This way all current VA Pulmonary Medicine Service sites are covered, the upper ranges 
are calculated for future facilities in case a higher projected workload or FTE positions 
authorized than those at the present time for Pulmonary Medicine Service.
F. The SPCM metrics are translated into one (or more) Room Criteria Statement (RCS) for 
each room in Section 5 of this document. The SPCM Planning Range, the maximum 
number of directly workload-driven exam rooms, in this document is 15. If a project 
shall require provision of workload driven rooms above the maximum range value refer 
to CFM for guidance. Rooms in this space planning document are organized in 8 
Functional Areas (FAs).
G. Based on its intended function, each room / space is assigned a:
1. Room Name (RN),
2. Room Code (RC),
3. Room Area, the Net Square Feet (NSF) and its corresponding “soft metric” Net 
Square Meters (NSM),
4. Unique Room Criteria Statement(s) (RCSs) correlated to answers to Input Data 
Statements (IDSs), and
5. Room Comment as needed.
H. The Room Codes included in this chapter stem from the VA Room Family. A unique 
support space, that may have variable area, is assigned a unique Room Code and adopts 
the square footage, as needed, correlated to the room contents assigned which in turn 
correspond to the range for those rooms. A unique clinical space or a direct clinical 
support room, i.e., control room, system components room, etc. typically does not 
feature variable NSF. Patient Care room names for rooms unique to this chapter end in 
“, Pulm Svc”. Patient Care Support room names end in “, Bldg Sprt”, “Clncl Sprt”, “Stff 
Sprt”, or “, Vet Sprt”, correlating to Building, Clinical, Staff or Veteran Support room 
families.
I. Section 5, Sub-Section I lists the SEPS Importer Shortcuts used for implementation of 
Sections 4 & 5 in SEPS. These shortcuts are inserted into the Room Criteria Statement 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022
212 – Pulmonary Medicine Service
9 of 21
(RCS) for each room which upon upload into the Space and Equipment Planning System 
(SEPS) allowing planners developing VA healthcare projects to determine quantity and 
square footage of each room by performing mathematical or logical calculations. 
Shortcuts refer Input Data Statements (IDSs), Rooms or calculation parameters 
stemming from the SPCM.
J. SEPS is accessible to government healthcare planners and private sector consultants 
working on VA HC projects during their Period of Performance (PoP) through the 
MAX.gov website; government provided Training is a requisite for access.
K. SEPS incorporates a Net‐to‐Department Gross factor (NTDG) factor of 1.50 for 
Pulmonary Medicine Service and a Building Gross factor of 1.35 in the space calculation 
to generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross Square 
Feet (BGSF) respectively for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square 
Feet (NSF) for each range. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the NTDG factor 
is fixed.
L. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-5 Equipment Guidelist for the Room Content 
assignment for each room during the planning phase of a project.
M. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-12: Design Guide, if available, during the 
planning and design phases of a project. Not all PG-18-9 clinical chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 document, please refer to the VA-TIL.
N. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website.

6 PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. Pulmonary Medicine Service may be integrated with Non-Invasive Cardiology, 
Respiratory Care, Digestive Diseases – Endoscopy, or Ambulatory Surgery for patient 
convenience and for staff cross training opportunities.
B. Separation of inpatient and outpatient traffic should be considered to the greatest 
extent possible. Provide outpatient Reception Area separate from inpatient circulation 
when both patient types utilize the same departmental facilities.
C. Standardization of rooms and modular design should be considered to allow flexibility to 
adapt to new technologies and respond to changes in patient volumes.
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022
212 – Pulmonary Medicine Service
19 of 21
D. Connection to ancillary services, such as lab and pharmacy, should be considered.
E. The waiting room should be connected to the patient entrance corridor and be under 
the visual control of the receptionist. This space can be shared between adjacent 
services where appropriate.
F. Design should accommodate patient privacy and confidentiality in all areas, and in 
reception and patient care areas in particular. This includes visual and auditory 
considerations.
G. Where possible, the department should be configured to limit the mix of patient and 
service functions, and to maintain clear separation of clean and dirty functions to avoid 
cross contamination. For example, Clean and Soiled Utility rooms can be located at 
alternate ends of a department.
H. Corridors should be designed to a minimum of 8 feet clear width to accommodate 
passage of equipment or beds and two stretchers and/or wheelchairs. In non-patient 
areas and outpatient clinical spaces, corridors may be a minimum of 5 feet in clear 
width.
I. Administration and support areas should be located and designed to maximize staff and 
space efficiency, and reduce staff travel distances.
J. Plan for locating high volume services closer to patient waiting or building access points 
to decrease patient travel time/distance and increase staff responsiveness. Services with 
longer duration procedure times or low volume generation can be less centrally located.
K. Sharing of patient and staff support areas among adjacent services should be 
considered for efficient utilization of staff. For example, centralized check-in/check-out 
can reduce the total number of FTE’s required to provide this function over multiple 
service lines.
L. During design, NSF for Staff Lounge and Lockers may be combined with an adjacent 
department(s).
M. Verify room sizes and equipment layouts with equipment vendors prior to finalizing 
room layouts.
N. Refer to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management Technical Information Library (www.cfm.va.gov/til/) for additional 
technical criteria.
O. Refer to Design Guide for Pulmonary Medicine Service for a detailed discussion of 
functional and design considerations.

1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines Space Planning Criteria for Chapter 214: Clinical Services  
Administration. It applies to all medical facilities in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Affiliated: An arrangement whereby a school of medicine agrees to staff a VA facility with 
faculty physicians, residents, and interns / externs. In return, the VA provides the medical 
school with a venue to train new physicians. In this arrangement, the VA retains 
responsibility for the care of its patients while the school of medicine retains responsibility 
for all graduate level education and training. 
Clinical Service Levels: 
Level A: An affiliated service with at least 80 patient beds or, in the case of a Mental Health 
Clinic, at least 60 patient beds. 
Level B: Non-bed clinical services with an affiliated program, or clinical service with less than 
80 patient beds or, in the case of Mental Health Clinic, less than 60 patient beds. 
Level C: non-affiliated service with at least 80 patient beds or, in the case of a Mental Health 
Clinic, at least 60 patient beds. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
214 – Clinical Services Administration 
3 of 16 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning system (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs.  
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter.

214 – Clinical Services Administration 
4 of 16 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing

Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Clinical 
Services Administration Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as a basis for 
this chapter. The SPCM lists all the spaces a VA site would require for Clinical Services 
Administration; the quantity and NSF for each room is calculated based on the projected 
number of services. The Clinical Service Administration is organized in 10 ranges, 
corresponding to the following Services: 
1. Medical Service 
2. Hospital Medicine 
3. Endocrinology Service 
4. Rheumatology Service 
5. Infectious Disease 
6. Homeless / Compensated Work Therapy (CWT), 
7. Neurology Service, 
8. Dermatology Service, 
9. Geriatrics Home Based Primary Care (HBPC), and 
10. Oncology Service. 
B. The Quantity (Q) and area (NSF) values developed in the SPCM are reflected in the 
Room Criteria Statements, placed immediately below each room name, room code and 
NSF/NSM, for each room in Section 5 of this document. The number of FTE positions 
authorized is included in the Input Data Statement in Section 4. Both Sections are 
implemented in the Space Planning and Equipment System (SEPS) software accessible 
through the MAX.gov website. Planners programming a VA Clinical Services 
Administration project shall develop a baseline Program for Design (PFD) in SEPS. 
C. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross factor (NTDG) factor of 1.30 for Clinical 
Service Administration projects and a Building Gross (BGS) factor of 1.35 to the 
aggregate Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) of all the departments included in the 
project to generate the Building Gross Square Feet (BGSF). Planners can adjust the BGSF 
factor in SEPS; the NTDG factor is fixed. 
D. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website.

A. Each service administration should be conveniently located to vertical transportation, 
main corridor systems, and / or adjacent to programs supervised. 
B. Alternatively, due to the constant interaction among Services in all sections, all office / 
workstations space should be contiguous and the whole Department should be located 
on the same floor if possible. 
C. Do not duplicate Staff Physician workstations with those listed for nursing units. 
D. Interview Rooms, Staff Toilets, and Resident Workstations can be shared among 
Services when Services are co-located to reduce duplication. 
E. Refer to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management Technical Information Library (www.cfm.va.gov/til/) for additional 
technical criteria.

1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines Space Planning Criteria for Chapter 218: Veterans Assistance Unit. 
It applies to all medical facilities at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
The Veterans Assistance Unit includes offices within the medical center for veterans’ 
benefits counselors to serve veteran patients, their relatives and non-patient veterans. 
Veteran’s benefits counselors, under the jurisdiction of the Veterans Benefits 
Administration, provide information, advice and assistance related to benefits under laws 
administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and other agencies; they also 
assist in the preparation of claims for these benefits. 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and 
escalators, shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this 
factor at 1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for 
Design (PFD) in SEPS. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square 
Feet (DGSF) area. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical 
formulation assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline 
space program or Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or 
may not have additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information 
about the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the 
parameters set forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through 
mathematical and logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning system 
(SEPS). 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022

JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived 
from that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and

ranges reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this 
document Space Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, 
a ‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care 
Support; Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and 
Residential Clinical. There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: 
Building Support, Clinical Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a 
Family has a unique Room Code and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and 
function which correspond to the specific use of the room. The same RC can be assigned 
to different Room Names with the same function in this document and can be assigned an 
NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) 
containing a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, 
and construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/

3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Veterans 
Assistance Unit Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as a basis for this 
chapter. The SPCM lists all the spaces a VA site would require; the quantity and NSF 
for each room is calculated based on the projected number Veterans Assistance Unit 
Benefits Counselor FTE positions. The Veterans Assistance Unit is organized in 10 
ranges, each range represents one Benefits Counselor the driver for this chapter. The 
ranges cover between 1 and 10 Counselors with the intent to cover all current and 
future Veterans Assistance Unit sites. 
B. The Quantity (Q) and area (NSF) values developed in the SPCM are reflected in the 
Room Criteria Statements, placed immediately below each room name, room code 
and NSF/NSM, for each room in Section 5 of this document. The number of Benefits 
Counselors FTE positions authorized is included in the Input Data Statement in Section 
4. Both Sections are implemented in the Space Planning and Equipment System (SEPS) 
software accessible through the MAX.gov website. Planners programming a VA 
Veterans Assistance Unit project shall develop a baseline Program for Design (PFD) in 
SEPS. 
C. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross factor (NTDG) factor of 1.20 for 
Veterans Assistance Unit projects and a Building Gross (BGS) factor of 1.35 to the 
aggregate Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) of all the departments included in 
the project to generate the Building Gross Square Feet (BGSF). Planners can adjust the 
BGSF factor in SEPS; the NTDG factor is fixed.

This document outlines Space Planning Criteria for Chapter 220: Credit Union. It applies to 
all medical facilities in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Credit Union: A cooperative organization chartered by state or federal government that 
accepts savings from its members and makes low interest loans to its members. Credit 
unions are normally formed among members who are employed by the same company or 
are members of the same organization. 
Full Service Credit Union: A program that employs a full-time staff to serve eligible Credit 
Union members. 
Itinerant Service Credit Union: A program of part-time service provided by a full-time Credit 
Union employee based at another location, making scheduled visits, or by a part- time 
employee designated to serve on a regular schedule. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or

3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Credit Union 
Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as a basis for this chapter. The SPCM 
lists all the spaces a VA Credit Union site would require; the quantity and NSF for each 
room is calculated based on Level1, Level2 or Full Service assigned category, hence the 
SPCM is organized in three ranges. 
B. The Quantity (Q) and are (NSF) values included in the SPCM are reflected in the Room 
Criteria Statements, placed immediately below each room name, room code and 
NSF/NSM, for each room in Section 5 of this document. The Credit Union Service Level is 
included in the Input Data Statement in Section 4. Both Sections are implemented in the 
Space Planning and Equipment System (SEPS) software accessible through the MAX.gov 
website. Planners programming a VA Clinical Service Administration project shall

1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines space planning criteria for services and programs provided in VA 
Chapter 222: Dental Service for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). It applies to all 
medical facilities at the VA. 
Dental Clinics may be located in outpatient clinics, which include both freestanding 
community-based facilities, as well as ambulatory clinics in or directly adjacent to hospitalbased
services. Dental clinics may also be incorporated within hospitals to provide dental 
care required as an adjunct to medical care, to support an oral surgery program, and to 
provide routine beneficiary care. 
Policies and directives, VA Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) input, and established and / or 
anticipated best practice guidelines / standards provide the foundation for the function and 
space allocation. Workload parameters determined in VA’s Office of Dentistry Dental 
Utilization Modeler are the basis for the space criteria calculations to determine the 
quantity and area, Net Square Feet (NSF), for each space. 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Automated External Defibrillator (AED): An AED or automated external defibrillator is a 
computerized medical device which can check a person’s heart rhythm. It can recognize a 
rhythm that requires a shock, and it can advise the rescuer when a shock is needed. AEDs 
are typically placed in targeted public areas such as outpatient clinics, doctor’s offices, office 
complexes, sports arenas, gated communities, shopping malls, and many others. They are 
wall-mounted, highly visible, and accessible to everyone. The Americans with Disabilities 
Act requires that objects not protrude more than 4 inches into foot traffic areas of open 
aisles and walkways (hallways) unless the object's bottom edge is no higher than 27 inches 
from the ground. 
CAD / CAM: CAD / CAM dentistry (computer-aided design and computer-aided 
manufacturing), is a field of dentistry using CAD or CAM technology to provide a range of 
dental restorations including: crowns, veneers, inlays / onlays, fixed bridges, dental implant 
restorations and orthodontic appliances. 
Cone Beam Computerized Tomography: Cone beam computed tomography (or CBCT) is a 
medical imaging technique. CBCT has become increasingly important in treatment planning, 
diagnosis, and patient education. During a CBCT scan, the scanner rotates around the 
patient's head, obtaining up to nearly 600 distinct images. The result is a more accurate 
image without missing information and a considerably lower radiation exposure. Through 
the use of specialized software, these images can be used to create a virtual dental model 
of the patient. 
Conscious Sedation: Conscious sedation induces an altered state of consciousness where 
patients are awake and are usually able to respond to verbal cues throughout the 
procedure, communicating any discomfort they experience to the provider. 
Dental Hygienist: Dental professional specializing in preventive dental care to include 
cleaning teeth, periodontal maintenance and educating patients in proper oral hygiene.

Dental Utilization Modeler: A VA produced planning tool used to determine the Dental 
Clinical Resources for a given year for VA Dental Clinics. The modeler addresses each Dental 
Clinic at the administrative parent level within the VA system by considering workload 
measured in RVUs, staffing, and space requirements. “What-if” scenarios are easily 
performed using the Dental Utilization Modeler. 
Dentist: A medical professional trained in the evaluation, diagnosis, prevention and 
treatment of diseases and conditions of the teeth and associated oral structures. 
Dental X-ray: Intra-oral, Panoramic, Cephalometric: Cephalometric x-rays capture a 
radiographic image of the entire head, usually in profile. Intra-oral x-rays provide an image 
of several teeth at a time, and panoramic x-rays generate a “wrap-around” image of the 
patient’s mouth. 
Digital Dentistry: Digital dentistry is any dental technology or device that incorporates 
digital or computer-controlled components. 
Endodontics: The dental specialty concerned with the morphology, physiology and 
pathology of the dental pulp and associated tissues. The most common procedure done in 
endodontics is root-canal therapy. 
General Practice Dental Resident: A dentist participating in an accredited post-doctoral 
dental training program that provides experience in a comprehensive range of dental care. 
Residency programs may be 1 or 2 years in duration. 
Maxillofacial: Of or relating to the jaws and face with particular reference to specialized 
surgery of mouth and adjoining structures, often referred to as maxillofacial surgery. 
Oral Surgeon: A dentist who specializes in oral and maxillofacial surgery including surgery of 
the mouth and removal of teeth. 
Panoramic / Cephalometric (Pan-Ceph): The Pan-Ceph x-ray is a full lateral high-contrast 
view of the bony tissues of the head including the mandible, used to make accurate 
volumetric measurements, evaluate dentofacial proportions and clarify the anatomic basis 
for a malocclusion. 
Panoramic x-ray: A type of extraoral x-ray that shows the entire mouth (all the teeth in both 
the upper and lower jaws) on a single image using specialized equipment. A panoramic x-ray 
image allows the dentist to detect the position of erupted as well as erupting teeth, identify 
impacted teeth, and aid in the diagnosis of tumors. 
Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS): A medical imaging technology which 
provides economical storage of, and convenient access to, images generated from digital 
radiography devices. 
Periodontics: The dental specialty that includes the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of 
diseases of the gums and supporting structures of the teeth, and the maintenance of the 
health of these tissues and structures.

Prep / Recovery Room: Depending on the facility and the mission, after oral surgery 
procedures, a patient may be allowed to recover in the surgical room, or the patient may be 
walked to a recliner chair to recover in a recovery room. Sometimes, oral surgeons perform 
long, complicated procedures in a hospital or in an ambulatory surgery center; in this case a 
gurney may be used to transfer a patient to the recovery room. 
Prosthodontics: The area of dentistry that included the diagnosis, treatment planning, 
rehabilitation, and maintenance of patients with complex restorative conditions. Patients 
may have missing teeth and / or oral tissues that can be rehabilitated with crowns, veneers, 
fixed and removable partial dentures, and implant-supported prostheses. 
Relative Value Unit (RVU): A numeric measure of workload developed by VA’s Dental Coding 
Committee absent other CMS measurement standards. One RVU approximates one minute 
of provider time to deliver clinical patient services based on the original assumption that 
only one dental operatory and only one dental assistant is available to the provider. Current 
studies indicate greatest efficiency when the assistant to provider ratio is minimally 1.75:1. 
The assistant to provider ratio is highly correlated to the treatment room to provider ratio 
which should always exceed the former. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Accessible: A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with provisions outlined 
in the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA). 
Architectural Barriers Act (ABA): A set of standards developed to ensure that all buildings 
financed with federal funds are designed and constructed to be fully accessible to everyone. 
This law requires all construction, renovation, or leasing of sites, facilities, buildings, and 
other elements, financed with federal funds, to comply with the Architectural Barriers Act 
Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). The ABAAS replaces the Uniform Federal Accessibility 
Standards (UFAS). 
Average Length of Encounter (ALoE): Averaged length of time, in minutes, a patient spends 
in an Exam / Treatment Room interacting with a provider and the clinical support team. It is 
accounted from room “set-up” to “clean-up” by staff. This metric is used to determine the 
number of annual patient / provider encounters that take place in an Exam / Treatment 
Room which, in turn, is used to calculate the number of Exam / Treatment Rooms needed in 
a facility based on projected annual workload. The ALoE is determined with VHA SME input 
during a PG-18-9 clinical chapter revision / update. 
Average Length of Stay (ALoS): The average number of days a patient Veteran stays in an 
inpatient care unit. The ALoS is used to calculate the number of patient bedrooms for a 
specialty by dividing the site’s projected workload by the ALoS.

5 of 29 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Clinic Stop: Per these criteria, a clinic stop is the workload unit of measure for space 
planning. Clinic Stops are codified by VSSC, when applicable, they are referenced by number 
in the calculation of workload driven patient care spaces in this document. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Encounter: An interaction between a patient Veteran and a VA provider or providers in an 
Exam Room / Treatment Room / Consultation Room / Procedure Room, spaces where a 
patient Veteran received clinical care. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
222 – Dental Service 
6 of 29 
Patient Unique: (or Unique Patient), A Veteran patient counted as a unique in each division 
from which they receive care. Patient Uniques are included in the Registry for a VA Medical 
Center. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs.  
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Provider: An individual who examines, diagnoses, treats, prescribes medication, and 
manages the care of patients within his or her scope of practice as established by the 
governing body of a healthcare organization. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project.

Room Efficiency Factor: A factor that provides flexibility in the utilization of a room to 
account for patient delays, scheduling conflicts, and equipment maintenance. Common 
factors are in the 75% to 85% range. A room with 80% room efficiency provides a buffer to 
assume that this room would be available 20% of the time beyond the planned operational 
practices for this room. This factor may be adjusted based on the actual and/or anticipated 
operations and processes of the room/department at a particular facility. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
Stop Code: A measure of workload including clinic stops forecasted by the Office of Policy 
and Planning (OPP) for all Strategic Planning Categories at Medical Center and Outpatient 
Clinic levels. 
Telehealth: The use of technology, such as computers and mobile devices, to manage 
healthcare remotely. It includes a variety of health care services, including but not limited to 
online support groups, online health information and self-management tools, email and 
online communication with health care providers, remote monitoring of vital signs, video, 
or online doctor visits. Depending on the concept of operations for this space, it may be 
equipped as an exam room or as a consult room with video/camera capability. 
Utilization Rate: A factor used in the calculation of a directly workload-driven room 
throughput. It represents, in a percent value, the room is idle based on the planning 
assumptions. For example, if a directly workload-driven room is available for use 8 hours a 
day, the Utilization Rate represents the assumed time it will be used, an 85% utilization rate 
indicates, for planning purposes, the room will be used 6.8 hours a day. An additional 
directly workload-driven room will be provided in the calculation once the previous room 
has reached 100% utilization. The utilization Rate is embedded in the Room Throughput 
value calculated in Section 3 of this document.

8 of 29 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
Workstation: Area outfitted with equipment and furnishings, typically allocated 56 NSF 
each. Managers and other staff with no direct reports as well as part-time, seasonal, and 
job-sharing staff may qualify for a workstation. Such environments are particularly 
conducive to team-oriented office groupings. These environments work best when they 
have access to conference and small group meeting spaces. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space planning criteria included in this Standard have been specifically developed for 
this Department / Service in a Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare facility based 
on established VHA policy and guidelines to define the scope of services provided for 
the existing workload demand as well as that in the foreseeable future. Rooms and 
Functional Areas are provided based on research of clinical and non-clinical activities 
performed in this Department. 
B. Development / update of VA’s Program Guide (PG) standards is a research based effort 
executed with participation of VHA Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), VA-Construction and 
Facilities Management Office (CFM) professional staff and specialty consultants hired for 
the task. These space planning standards are based on current applicable VHA policies 
and guidelines, established and/or anticipated best practice standards, and latest 
medical technology developments. Workload metrics were tailored to satisfy current 
and anticipated veteran workload demand.

C. The space planning component of PG-18-9 is based on the Space Planning Concept 
Matrix (SPCM) which lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and assigns room 
quantity (Q) and area (NSF) for a series of ranges corresponding to the smallest to the 
largest department for this service in the VA healthcare system in incremental size; each 
range corresponds to a workload parameter which determines the number and area of 
each directly workload-driven room. The remainder of the rooms in the range i.e., 
waiting, storage, staff workstations, etc. are determined by ratios to the resulting 
number of or NSF of the workload-driven rooms. 
D. Sections 4 and 5 of these space planning standards as well as the PG-18-5 standard are 
implemented in the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) and hosted at the 
MAX.gov website so planners working on VA Construction projects can develop single or 
multi-department projects based on these PG-18-9- and the PG-18-5 standards. Output 
from SEPS is through Space and Contents Reports; the Space Report is the Program for 
Design (PFD), the Content Report is the Project Room Contents (PRC). Inclusion of a 
Functional Area as well as Room quantity (Q) and determination of the room area (NSF) 
in the PFD is based on the projected Workload input which triggers calculations included 
in the Room Criteria Statements (RCSs). The RCSs are placed immediately after each 
room name, room code and baseline area (NSF). The PRC list the medical equipment, 
furniture and fixtures associated to each Room Code in the project. The PFD & PRC are 
the baseline requirements for the planning phase of a VA project based on a site’s 
projected workload for the target planning year. This chapter’s corresponding PG-18-12, 
Design Guide -if available- is intended for use during the design phase of the project. 
E. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Dental 
Service Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as the basis for this chapter. 
The Dental Service SPCM lists all the spaces a VA Dental Service site would require; the 
quantity and NSF for each room is calculated based on the Dental Service projected 
workload or number of FTE positions authorized. The SPCM is organized in 20 ranges, 
each range represents an incremental workload value of 1 Dental Treatment Room 
(DTR). Planner shall consult the VA Office of Dentistry Dental Modeler to determine 
projected number of DTRs for a site prior to starting a Dental Clinic project in SEPS. 
Current VA Dental Service sites are covered in the SPCM. The upper ranges are 
calculated for future facilities in case a higher projected workload or FTE positions 
authorized than those at the present time for Dental Service. 
F. The SPCM metrics are translated into one (or more) Room Criteria Statement (RCS) for 
each room in Section 5 of this document. The SPCM Planning Range, the maximum 
number of directly workload-driven patient bedroom, in this document is 20. If a project 
shall require provision of workload driven rooms above the maximum range value refer 
to CFM for guidance. Rooms in this space planning document are organized in 7 
Functional Areas (FAs).

G. Based on its intended function, each room / space is assigned a: 
1. Room Name (RN), 
2. Room Code (RC), 
3. Room Area, the Net Square Feet (NSF) and its corresponding “soft metric” Net 
Square Meters (NSM), 
4. Unique Room Criteria Statement(s) (RCSs) correlated to answers to Input Data 
Statements (IDSs), and 
5. Room Comment as needed. 
H. The Room Codes included in this chapter stem from the VA Room Family. A unique 
support space, that may have variable area, is assigned a unique Room Code and adopts 
the square footage, as needed, correlated to the room contents assigned which in turn 
correspond to the range for those rooms. A unique clinical space or a direct clinical 
support room, i.e., control room, system components room, etc. typically does not 
feature variable NSF. Patient Care room names for rooms unique to this chapter end in 
“, Dental Clnc”. Patient Care Support room names end in “, Bldg Sprt”, “Clncl Sprt”, “Stff 
Sprt”, or “, Vet Sprt”, correlating to Building, Clinical, Staff or Veteran Support room 
families. 
I. Section 5, Sub-Section H lists the SEPS Importer Shortcuts used for implementation of 
Sections 4 & 5 in SEPS. These shortcuts are inserted into the Room Criteria Statement 
(RCS) for each room which upon upload into the Space and Equipment Planning System 
(SEPS) allowing planners developing VA healthcare projects to determine quantity and 
square footage of each room by performing mathematical or logical calculations. 
Shortcuts refer Input Data Statements (IDSs), Rooms or calculation parameters 
stemming from the SPCM. 
J. SEPS is accessible to government healthcare planners and private sector consultants 
working on VA HC projects during their Period of Performance (PoP) through the 
MAX.gov website; government provided Training is a requisite for access. 
K. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross factor (NTDG) factor of 1.55 for Dental 
Service and a Building Gross factor of 1.35 in the space calculation to generate the 
Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross Square Feet (BGSF) 
respectively for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet (NSF) for 
each range. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the NTDG factor is fixed. 
L. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-5 Equipment Guidelist for the Room Content 
assignment for each room during the planning phase of a project. 
M. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-12: Design Guide, if available, during the 
planning and design phases of a project. Not all PG-18-9 clinical chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 document, please refer to the VA-TIL. 
N. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website.

6 PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. General: 
1. Create welcoming environments for patients and families by reducing 
environmental stressors, and typical "dental stressors". Daylighting, views of 
nature, gardens, and nature photography may alleviate patient anxiety, and 
provide positive distractions in waiting areas and treatment rooms. 
2. Design for flexibility and adaptability to accommodate future expansion. 
3. Consider physical layouts and design features that maximize non-institutional 
environmental aspects in order to provide a more therapeutic environment. 
4. Comply with safety and ergonomics standards. 
5. Design the Dental Clinic to provide access to patients with different levels of 
ability. It should be fully accessible. 
6. Design the Dental Clinic to support patient privacy and patient rights 
requirements. 
7. Where possible, locate clinics proximate to public parking and the main facility 
entrance to improve access and minimize travel distance. 
8. Clearly define patient circulation and provide “visual queues” to facilitate ease 
of patient wayfinding. Create separate paths of travel where possible between 
patients and staff (“on stage” and “off stage”) to support privacy, safety and 
patient / staff satisfaction. 
9. Main corridors should be designed to a minimum of 8 feet clear width to 
accommodate passage of equipment, stretchers, and / or wheelchairs. In non- 
patient areas, corridors may be 6 feet in clear width. 
10. Consider locating treatment areas for high volume, quick turn-around, patient 
visits near the front of the clinical area. 
11. Refer to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Construction and 
Facilities Management Technical Information Library (www.cfm.va.gov/til/) for 
additional technical criteria. 
B. Reception Area: 
1. Provide audio privacy at patient registration and check-out areas. 
2. Visual access from Reception to the Waiting Area should be provided. 
3. The Playroom should be designed with durable and easy to clean surfaces. Consider 
specifying child “play stations” in lieu of individual toys. 
C. Dental Treatment Patient Area: 
1. Views to the outside are desirable from Dental Treatment Rooms in order to reduce 
patient stress. Patients who have PTSD also benefit from having visual access to the 
outside. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
222 – Dental Service 
27 of 29 
2. Multi-purpose Dental Treatment Rooms are designed to provide a wide range of 
dental services including General Dentistry, Dental Hygiene, Prosthodontics, and 
Periodontics. 
3. Endodontic Dental Treatment Rooms are designed similarly to Multi-purpose Dental 
Treatment Rooms with the inclusion of a microscope. Other dental procedures may 
be performed in this area as scheduled. 
4. Special Needs Dental Treatment Rooms are designed to accommodate patients with 
different levels of ability. The design of these rooms should promote flexibility in 
order to accommodate each patient’s specific needs. Ceiling lifts in this area must 
support Bariatric patients. 
5. Design Dental Treatment Rooms to accommodate multiple caregivers. 
6. Intra-oral X-ray capability will be provided in the Dental Treatment Rooms. A 
dedicated X-ray room will be provided only for Panoramic / Cephalometric unit and / 
or Cone Beam Unit. 
7. Shielding design for rooms containing dental radiographic equipment does not 
necessarily require lead-lined walls. Normal building materials may be sufficient in 
most cases. Consult the VHA National Health Physics Program Office for direction on 
radiation protection. In addition, the National Council for Radiation Protection 
(NCRP) requires that shielding design be provided by a qualified expert for all new or 
remodeled dental facilities. When a conventional building structure does not 
provide adequate shielding, the shielding must be increased by providing a greater 
thickness of building materials or by adding lead. Adequacy of shielding is 
determined by a radiation physicist through calculations and checked by survey 
measurements. These determinations should be made in the design phase of the 
project. 
D. Dental Surgery Suite Patient Area: 
1. Locate Oral Surgery Rooms adjacent to each other. 
E. Dental Laboratories: 
1. Provide natural light in Dental Labs, particularly the Acrylics Finishing Lab, to 
facilitate the color matching of dental prosthetics. 
F. Support Area: 
1. Centralized support should be considered to maximize staff and space efficiency. 
G. Staff and Administrative Area: 
1. Locate the Staff Lounge, Staff Locker / Changing Room, Staff Toilets, and Staff Toilet 
/ Shower convenient to staff work areas but separate from patient areas. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
222 – Dental Service 
28 of 29 
2. Design space to foster effective staff collaboration. Central location of circulating 
corridors and visually open workstations will increase the quality and probability of 
unplanned interactions. Informal meeting spaces along hallways with flexibly 
arranged furniture and small niches with surfaces that allow stand-up work will 
encourage informal collaboration. Locating the team collaboration rooms and 
conference rooms close to individual spaces will promote problem solving. 
H. Residency Program: 
1. Work areas for residents should be grouped in one area close to staff dentists. The 
Conference Room (when provided) should be near the administrative spaces.

1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines Space Planning Criteria for Chapter 226: Electroencephalography 
(EEG) Laboratory. It applies to all medical facilities in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Electroencephalography (EEG): A neurophysiologic measurement method which graphically 
records the electrical activities of the brain along the cerebral cortex from electrodes 
applied to the scalp. Electrical currents are not measured, but rather voltage differences are 
measured among different parts of the brain. The resulting traces are known as an 
electroencephalogram (also EEG) and represent the postsynaptic potentials (electrical 
signals) from a large number of neurons. The EEG is a brain function test, and in clinical use 
it is a correlate of brain activity, recordings of which are used in the diagnosis of epilepsy, 
trauma, tumor, and other brain diseases. 
Electromyogram (EMG): A test used to record the electrical activity of muscles. When 
muscles are active, they produce an electrical current that is usually proportional to the 
level of muscle activity. An electromyogram (EMG) is also called a myogram. 
Healthcare Planning Module: Methodology used to create a VISN Strategic Plan which 
defines how and where high-cost services should be delivered in each market. 
Neurophysiology: The part of physiology as a science which is concerned with the study of 
functioning of the nervous system. 
Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS): The digital capture, transfer, and 
storage of diagnostic images. A PACS system consists of: workstations for interpretation, 
image / data producing modalities, a web server for distribution, printers for file records, 
image servers for information transfer and holding, and an archive of off-line information. A 
computer network is needed to support digital imaging devices. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Accessible: A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with provisions outlined 
in the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA). 
Architectural Barriers Act (ABA): A set of standards developed to ensure that all buildings 
financed with federal funds are designed and constructed to be fully accessible to everyone. 
This law requires all construction, renovation, or leasing of sites, facilities, buildings, and 
other elements, financed with federal funds, to comply with the Architectural Barriers Act 
Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). The ABAAS replaces the Uniform Federal Accessibility 
Standards (UFAS). 
Average Length of Encounter (ALoE): Averaged length of time, in minutes, a patient spends 
in an Exam / Treatment Room interacting with a provider and the clinical support team. It is 
accounted from room “set-up” to “clean-up” by staff. This metric is used to determine the 
number of annual patient / provider encounters that take place in an Exam / Treatment 
Room which, in turn, is used to calculate the number of Exam / Treatment Rooms needed in 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
226 – Electroencephalography (EEG) Laboratory 
3 of 16 
a facility based on projected annual workload. The ALoE is determined with VHA SME input 
during a PG-18-9 clinical chapter revision / update. 
Average Length of Stay (ALoS): The average number of days a patient Veteran stays in an 
inpatient care unit. The ALoS is used to calculate the number of patient bedrooms for a 
specialty by dividing the site’s projected workload by the ALoS. 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Clinic Stop: Per these criteria, a clinic stop is the workload unit of measure for space 
planning. Clinic Stops are codified by VSSC, when applicable, they are referenced by number 
in the calculation of workload driven patient care spaces in this document. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Encounter: An interaction between a patient Veteran and a VA provider or providers in an 
Exam Room / Treatment Room / Consultation Room / Procedure Room, spaces where a 
patient Veteran received clinical care. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS). 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
226 – Electroencephalography (EEG) Laboratory 
4 of 16 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Patient Unique: (or Unique Patient), A Veteran patient counted as a unique in each division 
from which they receive care. Patient Uniques are included in the Registry for a VA Medical 
Center. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Provider: An individual who examines, diagnoses, treats, prescribes medication, and 
manages the care of patients within his or her scope of practice as established by the 
governing body of a healthcare organization. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
226 – Electroencephalography (EEG) Laboratory 
5 of 16 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
Room Efficiency Factor: A factor that provides flexibility in the utilization of a room to 
account for patient delays, scheduling conflicts, and equipment maintenance. Common 
factors are in the 75% to 85% range. A room with 80% room efficiency provides a buffer to 
assume that this room would be available 20% of the time beyond the planned operational 
practices for this room. This factor may be adjusted based on the actual and/or anticipated 
operations and processes of the room/department at a particular facility. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
Stop Code: A measure of workload including clinic stops forecasted by the Office of Policy 
and Planning (OPP) for all Strategic Planning Categories at Medical Center and Outpatient 
Clinic levels. 
Telehealth: The use of technology, such as computers and mobile devices, to manage 
healthcare remotely. It includes a variety of health care services, including but not limited to 
online support groups, online health information and self-management tools, email and 
online communication with health care providers, remote monitoring of vital signs, video, 
or online doctor visits. Depending on the concept of operations for this space, it may be 
equipped as an exam room or as a consult room with video/camera capability. 
Utilization Rate: A factor used in the calculation of a directly workload-driven room 
throughput. It represents, in a percent value, the room is idle based on the planning 
assumptions. For example, if a directly workload-driven room is available for use 8 hours a 
day, the Utilization Rate represents the assumed time it will be actually be used, an 85% 
utilization rate indicates, for planning purposes, the room will be used 6.8 hours a day. An 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
226 – Electroencephalography (EEG) Laboratory 
6 of 16 
additional directly workload-driven room will be provided in the calculation once the 
previous room has reached 100% utilization. The utilization Rate is embedded in the Room 
Throughput value calculated in Section 3 of this document. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
Workstation: Area outfitted with equipment and furnishings, typically allocated 56 NSF 
each. Managers and other staff with no direct reports as well as part-time, seasonal, and 
job-sharing staff may qualify for a workstation. Such environments are particularly 
conducive to team-oriented office groupings. These environments work best when they 
have access to conference and small group meeting spaces. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space planning criteria included in this Standard have been specifically developed for 
this Department / Service in a Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare facility based 
on established VHA policy and guidelines to define the scope of services provided for 
the existing workload demand as well as that in the foreseeable future. Rooms and 
Functional Areas are provided based on research of clinical and non-clinical activities 
performed in this Department. 
B. Development / update of VA’s Program Guide (PG) standards is a research based effort 
executed with participation of VHA Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), VA-Construction and 
Facilities Management Office (CFM) professional staff and specialty consultants hired for 
the task. These space planning standards are based on current applicable VHA policies 
and guidelines, established and/or anticipated best practice standards, and latest 
medical technology developments. Workload metrics were tailored to satisfy current 
and anticipated veteran workload demand. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
226 – Electroencephalography (EEG) Laboratory 
7 of 16 
C. The space planning component of PG-18-9 is based on the Space Planning Concept 
Matrix (SPCM) which lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and assigns room 
quantity (Q) and area (NSF) for a series of ranges corresponding to the smallest to the 
largest department for this service in the VA healthcare system in incremental size; each 
range corresponds to a workload parameter which determines the number and area of 
each directly workload-driven room. The remainder of the rooms in the range i.e., 
waiting, storage, staff workstations, etc. are determined by ratios to the resulting 
number of or NSF of the workload-driven rooms. 
D. Sections 4 and 5 of these space planning standards as well as the PG-18-5 standard are 
implemented in the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) and hosted at the 
MAX.gov website so planners working on VA Construction projects can develop single or 
multi-department projects based on these PG-18-9- and the PG-18-5 standards. Output 
from SEPS is through Space and Contents Reports; the Space Report is the Program for 
Design (PFD), the Content Report is the Project Room Contents (PRC). Inclusion of a 
Functional Area as well as Room quantity (Q) and determination of the room area (NSF) 
in the PFD is based on the projected Workload input which triggers calculations included 
in the Room Criteria Statements (RCSs). The RCSs are placed immediately after each 
room name, room code and baseline area (NSF). The PRC list the medical equipment, 
furniture and fixtures associated to each Room Code in the project. The PFD & PRC are 
the baseline requirements for the planning phase of a VA project based on a site’s 
projected workload for the target planning year. This chapter’s corresponding PG-18-12, 
Design Guide -if available- is intended for use during the design phase of the project. 
E. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the EEG 
Laboratory Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as the basis for this 
chapter. The EEG Laboratory SPCM lists all the spaces a VA EEG Laboratory site would 
require; the quantity and NSF for each room is calculated based on the EEG Laboratory 
projected workload or number of FTE positions authorized. The SPCM is organized in 10 
ranges, each range represents an incremental workload value equivalent to one Patient 
Care Room, this way all current VA EEG Laboratory sites are covered, the upper ranges 
are calculated for future facilities in case a higher projected workload or FTE positions 
authorized than those at the present time for EEG Laboratory. 
F. The SPCM metrics are translated into one (or more) Room Criteria Statement (RCS) for 
each room in Section 5 of this document. The SPCM Planning Range, the maximum 
number of directly workload-driven patient care rooms, in this document is 10. If a 
project shall require provision of workload driven rooms above the maximum range 
value) refer to CFM for guidance. Rooms in this space planning document are organized 
in 5 Functional Areas (FAs). 
G. Based on its intended function, each room / space is assigned a: 
1. Room Name (RN), 
2. Room Code (RC), 
3. Room Area, the Net Square Feet (NSF) and its corresponding “soft metric” Net 
Square Meters (NSM), 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
226 – Electroencephalography (EEG) Laboratory 
8 of 16 
4. Unique Room Criteria Statement(s) (RCSs) correlated to answers to Input Data 
Statements (IDSs), and 
5. Room Comment as needed. 
H. The Room Codes included in this chapter stem from the VA Room Family. A unique 
support space, that may have variable area, is assigned a unique Room Code and adopts 
the square footage, as needed, correlated to the room contents assigned which in turn 
correspond to the range for those rooms. A unique clinical space or a direct clinical 
support room, i.e., control room, system components room, etc. typically does not 
feature variable NSF. Patient Care room names for rooms unique to this chapter end in 
“, EEG Lab”. Patient Care Support room names end in “, Bldg Sprt”, “Clncl Sprt”, “Stff 
Sprt”, or “, Vet Sprt”, correlating to Building, Clinical, Staff or Veteran Support room 
families. 
I. Section 5, Sub-Section F lists the SEPS Importer Shortcuts used for implementation of 
Sections 4 & 5 in SEPS. These shortcuts are inserted into the Room Criteria Statement 
(RCS) for each room which upon upload into the Space and Equipment Planning System 
(SEPS) allowing planners developing VA healthcare projects to determine quantity and 
square footage of each room by performing mathematical or logical calculations. 
Shortcuts refer Input Data Statements (IDSs), Rooms or calculation parameters 
stemming from the SPCM. 
J. SEPS is accessible to government healthcare planners and private sector consultants

MAX.gov website; government provided Training is a requisite for access. 
K. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross factor (NTDG) factor of 1.50 for EEG 
Laboratory and a Building Gross factor of 1.35 in the space calculation to generate the 
Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross Square Feet (BGSF) 
respectively for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet (NSF) for 
each range. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the NTDG factor is fixed. 
L. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-5 Equipment Guidelist for the Room Content 
assignment for each room during the planning phase of a project.

6 PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. This chapter applies specifically to equipment and facilities in a fixed location visited by 
patients. It does not include space programming information for portable services 
commonly associated with EEG Laboratories. Consider areas for portable EEG services 
when planning relates to other services, such as neurological surgery. 
B. As the EMG Exam Room may be utilized by other services such as Neurology, 
Rheumatology, and Rehabilitation Services, consider locating the EEG Laboratory 
adjacent to them for efficient utilization of staff and patient convenience. 
C. Consider grouping EEG and EMG Exam rooms together to reduce Provider travel 
distances. Standardization of rooms and modular design should be considered to allow 
flexibility to adapt to new technologies and respond to changes in patient volumes. 
D. Stable environmental conditions must be maintained as changes may be perceptible to 
patients and can create physical responses which impact readings. Temperature and 
relative humidity must be balanced to prohibit static electrical charges at all times. 
E. Acoustically isolate EEG and EMG Exam rooms to inhibit distracting stimuli which will 
alter the readings. 
F. Isolate EEG and EMG Exam from elevators, transformers, motors, and wiring carrying 
large amounts of current. Voltage, particularly, will impact the readings. 
G. Provide electronic grounding in the exam rooms and workrooms to prevent interference 
with the accuracy of the procedure. 
H. Connection to ancillary services, such as lab and pharmacy, should be considered. 
I. The waiting room should be connected to the patient entrance corridor to the 
department and be under the visual control of Reception / Check-in. This space can be 
shared between adjacent services where appropriate. 
J. Plan for locating the Patient Prep room adjacent to patient waiting to reduce patient 
travel time/distance and increase staff responsiveness. 
K. Design should accommodate patient privacy and confidentiality in all areas, and in 
reception and patient care areas in particular. This includes visual and auditory 
considerations. 
L. Where possible, the department should be configured to limit the mix of patient and 
service functions, and to maintain clear separation of clean and dirty functions to avoid 
cross contamination. For example, Clean and Soiled Utility rooms can be located at 
alternate ends of a department. 
M. Corridors should be designed to a minimum of 8 feet clear width to accommodate 
passage of equipment or beds and two stretchers and/or wheelchairs. In non-patient 
areas and outpatient clinical spaces, corridors may be a minimum of 5 feet in clear 
width. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
226 – Electroencephalography (EEG) Laboratory 
15 of 16 
N. Administration and support areas should be located and designed to maximize staff and 
space efficiency, and reduce staff travel distances. 
O. Sharing of patient and staff support areas among adjacent services should be 
considered for efficient utilization of staff. For example, centralized check-in/check-out 
can reduce the total number of FTEs required to provide this function over multiple 
service lines. 
P. During design, NSF for Staff Lounge and Lockers may be combined with an adjacent 
department(s). 
Q. Verify room sizes and equipment layouts with equipment vendors prior to finalizing 
room layouts. 
R. Refer to Design Guide for Electroencephalography Laboratory for a detailed discussion 
of functional and design considerations. 
S. Refer to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management Technical Information Library (www.cfm.va.gov/til/) for additional 
technical criteria.

1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document provides Space Planning Criteria for Engineering Service Chapter 230 as it 
applies to all medical facilities at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
Engineering Service is responsible for improving, maintaining, and operating the medical 
center physical plant and equipment, and for construction projects. The following services 
are provided by Engineering Service: Interior Design, Biomedical Repair, Carpentry, Air 
Conditioning, Plumbing, Electrical, Painting, 
Mechanical, Masonry, Grounds Maintenance, and Locksmithing. 
2. DEFINITIONS 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning system (SEPS). 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
230 – Engineering Service 
3 of 24 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
230 – Engineering Service 
4 of 24 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
3. OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Engineering 
Service Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as a basis for this chapter. The 
SPCM lists all the spaces a VA Engineering Service site would require; the quantity and 
NSF for each room is calculated based on the number of FTE positions assigned to each 
of the following specialties / ranges:  
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
230 – Engineering Service 
5 of 24 
B. The SPCM is organized in fifty-three ranges as follows: 
1. Interior Design, 8 ranges based on number of ID FTE positions (based on ID Staffing 
Tool), 
2. Biomedical Repair, Carpentry, Air Conditioning, Plumbing, Electrical, Painting, 
Mechanical, Masonry, Grounds Maintenance, Locksmitting, and Multi-Specialty 
based on the number of FTE positions authorized, 4 ranges each specialty. 
C. The Quantity (Q) and are (NSF) values included in the SPCM are reflected in the Room 
Criteria Statements, placed immediately below each room name, room code and 
NSF/NSM, for each room in Section 5 of this document. The number of Engineering 
Service FTE positions authorized is included in the Input Data Statement in Section 4. 
Both Sections are implemented in the Space Planning and Equipment System (SEPS) 
software accessible through the MAX.gov website. Planners programming a VA 
Engineering Service project shall develop a baseline Program for Design (PFD) in SEPS. 
D. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross (NTDG) factor of 1.30 for Engineering 
Service and a Building Gross (BG) factor of 1.35 in the space calculation. These factors 
generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross Square Feet 
(BGSF) for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet (NSF) for all 
Departments included. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the NTDG factor is 
fixed. 
E. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website. 
F. Engineering Service is responsible for construction projects and for improving, 
maintaining, and the operating the Medical Center’s physical plant and equipment. The 
Department is organized with an Office of the Chief of Engineering Service and six (6) 
other sections: Interior Design, Biomedical Engineering. maintenance and repair; 
operations; projects (construction); and safety, industrial hygiene, and fire protection.

6. PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
1. Administrative offices / workspaces should be in proximity to the main hospital 
administration complex. (Different floors are acceptable). 
2. Shop areas should be located adjacent to the loading dock and accessible to interior 
transport system. If not adjacent to the dock, then a double exterior opening door 
should be considered. Access is needed to move lengths of pipe and large sheets 
plywood and sheetrock. 
3. The engineering control room (ECC) shall be totally enclosed, air conditioned, and 
designed acoustically to provide an ambient noise level of not more than 50 Decibels. 
The control room shall be located so that visual surveillance of both the water chilling 
equipment and boiler plant equipment can be maintained. If this is not feasible, then 
the control room shall be located to provide visual surveillance of the water chilling 
equipment (or as recommended by the Engineering Officer). 
4. A vacuum system is required for the equipment utilized in carpentry work. A fume hood 
is required where welding is accomplished. 
5. Individual shops may be combined to form larger shops, or all shops may be combined 
into one large shop area. Shop storage areas may be combined. 
6. The workspace for the Biomedical Engineer may be located either with the biomedical 
Engineering shop or in the administrative office area.

7. If an automatic transport system (ATS) is planned for the medical center, then an ATS 
repair shop is required. The ATS shop should consist of a test track, workbench area, and 
a battery recharging area. Space must be determined on a project by project basis. 
8. Refer to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management Technical Information Library (www.cfm.va.gov/til/) for additional 
technical criteria.

1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document provides space planning criteria for telecommunications spaces and Office of 
Information & Technology (OIT) support spaces primarily as it applies to VA-owned 
hospitals, outpatient clinics, community-based outpatient clinics, and medical facilities for 
the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Space planning criteria applicable to Veterans 
Benefits Administration (VBA), National Cemetery Administration (NCA), and VA Central 
Office (VACO) facilities may not be as robust as for healthcare facilities and may require 
additional planning work; see guidance in the PG-18-12 Telecommunications Design Guide. 
Criteria for some leased facilities (e.g., Small House model Community Living Centers (CLCs), 
and Research & Development (R&D) facilities) operated by the VHA are covered by Lease 
Design Narrative (LDN) documents.
OIT is responsible for providing strategic and technical direction, guidance, and polices to 
ensure that information technology (IT) and telecommunications resources are best 
acquired and managed for VA, and is responsible for ensuring the efficient, effective, and 
secure operation of VA’s IT Management System.
Space planning criteria for the IT requirements of other VA users such as Facilities 
Management Service (FMS), Clinical Engineering (CE, also referred to as Healthcare 
Technology Management or Biomedical Engineering), Research & Development (R&D), and 
VA Police are integrated into these criteria. Telecommunications technology requirements 
for all VA users are satisfied through the use of converged physical media plants and shared 
telecommunications spaces.
Space planning criteria are primarily used when planning new facilities. The criteria

Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room.
VA-SEPS: SEPS Module where the VA’s PG-18-9 chapters are uploaded. There is a 
corresponding Module for MHS space planning criteria chapters. Planners working on 
projects on SEPS have access to both sets of space criteria to generate Agency specific

3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on current policies 
and practices, input from DCIE, and site visits as incorporated in the VA232 
Telecommunications Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM). The SPCM organizes the 
rooms / spaces for Telecommunication Facilities in five Functional Areas (FAs) and 
determines the Room Count and Room NSF for each room in thirty (30) ranges, each 
range represents an increment of the Estimates Number of End-Users.
B. The VA232 Telecom Functional Areas are:
1. Customer Area: front-end functions,
2. Equipment Area: Computer Room, Entrance Room, Antenna Entrance Room, and 
Network Support Center (NSC) functions,
3. Staff Area: Technician and Support Staff Stations, Imaging, and Projects Workrooms, 
Training Room, Area Manager, and Supervisor Offices, and staff support rooms.
4. Telecom Support Area: IT Equipment, Telecom Equipment, Secure and Supply 
Storage Rooms, and
5. Building Support Area: Receiving Dock, Breakdown Room, Equipment Prep / Staging 
Room, Mechanical, Electrical, and Generator Rooms, and Housekeeping Aides Room.
C. Rooms in each FA are identified by a Room Code (RM CD) and a Room Name (RM NM) 
following the VA Room Family definition. Rooms where core Telecom functions are 
performed, regardless of physical location, belong to the “, Telecom” family and are 
assigned a RC between SC301 to SC399. Additional rooms belong to the Staff Support 
and Building Support families. Each room is provided a starting room area in Net Square 
Feet (NSF), which could vary, as the room appears in different ranges, in response to 
workload requirements, for example a Waiting Room or a Storage Room in Patient Care 
areas.
D. The first Range defines the RM CT and RM NSF for 5 to 20 End-Users (EUs), Range Two 
covers an increment of 30 EUs, Range Three an increment of 50 EUs, Ranges Four to 
Twelve an increment of 100 EUs, the remaining eighteen ranges an increment of five 
hundred. EUs.
E. RM CT and RM NSF are defined for each Range in response to the range workload, this 
way, a room may not be provided for an End-User range value if assigned workload does 
not merit. Similarly, a Room Count greater than one may be assigned in response to the 
End-User range value. Room Counts and NSF values are defined for Telecom Projects 
serving between 5 and 10,000 End-Users, regardless of location or facility type, were 
assigned, discussed, tested and reviewed with participation of DCEI.
F. A project generated in SEPS for a given End-User value will generate a Baseline PFD 
corresponding to the projected workload -number of End-Users- Range. Planners are 
able to modify any of the values reflecting the specific additional requirements of the 
site and provide reasoning accordingly.

G. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross factor (NTDG) factor of 1.40 for 
Telecommunication Facilities and a Building Gross factor of 1.35 in the space calculation 
to generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross Square 
Feet (BGSF) respectively for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square 
Feet (NSF) for each range. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the NTDG factor 
is fixed. The NTDG for this Standard was updated based on area Take-offs of recent VA 
projects.
H. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library Management System (TIL-MS)

as space allotments, not typically as physical elements. A TE may be located in its 
own dedicated space or in a non-dedicated space meeting the physical security 
requirements. In non-dedicated spaces the allotment typically increases the 
allotment of the non-dedicated space such that the functionality of that containing 
space is not disrupted by the insertion of the TE. This room is included in this 
document with 0 NSF for reference, it is provided in the Patient Care and Patient 
Care Support PG-18-9 Chapters as needed.
G. SEPS IMPORTER SHORTCUTS 
The following shortcuts are inserted in the Room Criteria Statement (RCS) for every 
room in this chapter, they are used by the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) 
software to perform the calculations or apply the conditions in the RCS to generate the 
number of rooms and their resulting area based on User answers to the Input Data 
Statements (IDSs), the results are reflected in the project Program for Design (PFD). 
Although shortcuts are primarily used to “shorten” IDSs, they can also refer to rooms or 
groups of rooms.

Affiliated: An arrangement whereby a school of medicine or optometry agrees to staff a VA 
facility with faculty physicians (ophthalmologists), optometrists, residents, and interns / 
externs. In return, the VA provides the medical or optometry school with a venue to train 
new physicians / optometrists. In this arrangement, the VA retains responsibility for the 
care of its patients while the school of medicine or optometry retains responsibility for all 
graduate level education and training. 
Basic Low Vision Services: Basic Low Vision services include prescription of optical low vision 
devices and a minimum level of visual skills and device training. 
Blind Rehabilitation Outpatient Specialist (BROS): A BROS is a multi-skilled, university- 
trained, and experienced blind rehabilitation instructor who has advanced technical 
knowledge and competencies at the full performance level in at least two of the following 
disciplines: orientation and mobility, living skills, manual skills, and visual skills. (per VHA 
Handbook 1174.05) 
Eye Care Provider: An Optometrist or Ophthalmologist who examines, diagnoses, treats, 
prescribes medication, and manages the care of patients within his or her clinical privileges 
as established by the governing body of a healthcare organization. 
Low Vision: A combination of visual acuity, visual field loss, contrast sensitivity loss, loss of 
stereopsis, or eye motility impairment that impacts patient safety or impairs or restricts one 
or more activities of daily living. 
Low Vision Therapy: Low Vision Therapy provides an individual with low vision to use his or 
her residual vision. This may also include training in the use of low vision and other aids in 
everyday situations and activities of daily living. Low Vision Services including Basic, 
Intermediate, Polytrauma Facility, Advanced, Visual Impairment Center to Optimize 
Remaining Sight (VICTORS), Polytrauma Rehabilitation Network Site, as well as Polytrauma 
Rehabilitation Center which may include Low Vision Services have separate staffing, space, 
and workload requirements based upon the level and intensity of vision rehabilitation care 
provided.

coordination of services for severely-disabled visually impaired Veterans and their families. 
(per VHA Handbook 1174.05) 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Accessible: A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with provisions outlined 
in the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA). 
Architectural Barriers Act (ABA): A set of standards developed to ensure that all buildings 
financed with federal funds are designed and constructed to be fully accessible to everyone. 
This law requires all construction, renovation, or leasing of sites, facilities, buildings, and 
other elements, financed with federal funds, to comply with the Architectural Barriers Act 
Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). The ABAAS replaces the Uniform Federal Accessibility 
Standards (UFAS). 
Average Length of Encounter (ALoE): Averaged length of time, in minutes, a patient spends 
in an Exam / Treatment Room interacting with a provider and the clinical support team. It is 
accounted from room “set-up” to “clean-up” by staff. This metric is used to determine the 
number of annual patient / provider encounters that take place in an Exam / Treatment 
Room which, in turn, is used to calculate the number of Exam / Treatment Rooms needed in 
a facility based on projected annual workload. The ALoE is determined with VHA SME input 
during a PG-18-9 clinical chapter revision / update. 
Average Length of Stay (ALoS): The average number of days a patient Veteran stays in an 
inpatient care unit. The ALoS is used to calculate the number of patient bedrooms for a 
specialty by dividing the site’s projected workload by the ALoS. 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022

4 of 33 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Clinic Stop: Per these criteria, a clinic stop is the workload unit of measure for space 
planning. Clinic Stops are codified by VSSC, when applicable, they are referenced by number 
in the calculation of workload driven patient care spaces in this document. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to

forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries.

5 of 33 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs.  
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Provider: An individual who examines, diagnoses, treats, prescribes medication, and 
manages the care of patients within his or her scope of practice as established by the 
governing body of a healthcare organization. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
Room Efficiency Factor: A factor that provides flexibility in the utilization of a room to 
account for patient delays, scheduling conflicts, and equipment maintenance. Common 
factors are in the 75% to 85% range. A room with 80% room efficiency provides a buffer to 
assume that this room would be available 20% of the time beyond the planned operational 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
233 – Eye Clinic: Ophthalmology and Optometry Services 
6 of 33 
practices for this room. This factor may be adjusted based on the actual and/or anticipated 
operations and processes of the room/department at a particular facility. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
Stop Code: A measure of workload including clinic stops forecasted by the Office of Policy 
and Planning (OPP) for all Strategic Planning Categories at Medical Center and Outpatient 
Clinic levels. 
Telehealth: The use of technology, such as computers and mobile devices, to manage 
healthcare remotely. It includes a variety of health care services, including but not limited to 
online support groups, online health information and self-management tools, email and 
online communication with health care providers, remote monitoring of vital signs, video, 
or online doctor visits. Depending on the concept of operations for this space, it may be 
equipped as an exam room or as a consult room with video/camera capability. 
Utilization Rate: A factor used in the calculation of a directly workload-driven room 
throughput. It represents, in a percent value, the room is idle based on the planning 
assumptions. For example, if a directly workload-driven room is available for use 8 hours a 
day, the Utilization Rate represents the assumed time it will be used, an 85% utilization rate 
indicates, for planning purposes, the room will be used 6.8 hours a day. An additional 
directly workload-driven room will be provided in the calculation once the previous room 
has reached 100% utilization. The utilization Rate is embedded in the Room Throughput 
value calculated in Section 3 of this document. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
233 – Eye Clinic: Ophthalmology and Optometry Services 
7 of 33 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
Workstation: Area outfitted with equipment and furnishings, typically allocated 56 NSF 
each. Managers and other staff with no direct reports as well as part-time, seasonal, and 
job-sharing staff may qualify for a workstation. Such environments are particularly 
conducive to team-oriented office groupings. These environments work best when they 
have access to conference and small group meeting spaces. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space planning criteria included in this Standard have been specifically developed for 
this Department / Service in a Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare facility based 
on established VHA policy and guidelines to define the scope of services provided for 
the existing workload demand as well as that in the foreseeable future. Rooms and 
Functional Areas are provided based on research of clinical and non-clinical activities 
performed in this Department. 
B. Development / update of VA’s Program Guide (PG) standards is a research based effort 
executed with participation of VHA Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), VA-Construction and 
Facilities Management Office (CFM) professional staff and specialty consultants hired for 
the task. These space planning standards are based on current applicable VHA policies 
and guidelines, established and/or anticipated best practice standards, and latest 
medical technology developments. Workload metrics were tailored to satisfy current 
and anticipated veteran workload demand. 
C. The space planning component of PG-18-9 is based on the Space Planning Concept 
Matrix (SPCM) which lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and assigns room 
quantity (Q) and area (NSF) for a series of ranges corresponding to the smallest to the 
largest department for this service in the VA healthcare system in incremental size; each 
range corresponds to a workload parameter which determines the number and area of 
each directly workload-driven room. The remainder of the rooms in the range i.e., 
waiting, storage, staff workstations, etc. are determined by ratios to the resulting 
number of or NSF of the workload-driven rooms. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022

8 of 33 
D. Sections 4 and 5 of these space planning standards as well as the PG-18-5 standard are 
implemented in the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) and hosted at the 
MAX.gov website so planners working on VA Construction projects can develop single or 
multi-department projects based on these PG-18-9- and the PG-18-5 standards. Output 
from SEPS is through Space and Contents Reports; the Space Report is the Program for 
Design (PFD), the Content Report is the Project Room Contents (PRC). Inclusion of a 
Functional Area as well as Room quantity (Q) and determination of the room area (NSF) 
in the PFD is based on the projected Workload input which triggers calculations included 
in the Room Criteria Statements (RCSs). The RCSs are placed immediately after each 
room name, room code and baseline area (NSF). The PRC list the medical equipment, 
furniture and fixtures associated to each Room Code in the project. The PFD & PRC are 
the baseline requirements for the planning phase of a VA project based on a site’s 
projected workload for the target planning year. This chapter’s corresponding PG-18-12, 
Design Guide -if available- is intended for use during the design phase of the project. 
E. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Eye Clinic 
Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as the basis for this chapter. The Eye 
Clinic SPCM lists all the spaces a VA Eye Clinic site would require for Ophthalmology 
Service, Optometry Service (Affiliated or Non-Affiliated), and Optical Fitting. The 
quantity and NSF for each room is calculated based on the projected workload for each 
Service, the workload throughputs for Affiliated and Non-Affiliated are different. The 
SPCM is organized in 30 ranges, 15 each for Ophthalmology and Optometry. Each range 
represents an incremental workload value equivalent to two Exam / Treatment Room. 
All current VA Eye Clinic sites are covered in the SPCM. The upper ranges are calculated 
for future facilities in case a higher projected workload. The SPCM is organized as 
follows: 
1. Ranges 1 to 15: Ophthalmology - Stop Code 407 
a. Affiliated: each range represents 3,600 annual clinic stops generating two 
Ophthalmology Exam / Treatment Rooms at an annual throughput of 1,800 clinic 
stops each; minimum annual workload 450. Ranges 1 to 15 cover between 450 
and 67,500 clinic stops. 
b. Non-Affiliated: each range represents 4,500 annual clinic stops generating two 
Ophthalmology Exam / Treatment Rooms at an annual throughput of 2,250 clinic 
stops each, minimum annual workload 583. Ranges 1 to 15 cover between 563 
and 54,000 clinic stops. 
2. Ranges 1 to 15: Optometry - Stop Code 408 
a. Affiliated: each range represents 3,840 annual clinic stops generating two 
Optometry Exam / Treatment Rooms at an annual throughput of 1,920 clinic 
stops each; minimum annual workload 384. Ranges 1 to 15 cover between 384 
and 57,600 clinic stops. 
b. Non-Affiliated: each range represents 4,800 annual clinic stops generating two 
Optometry Exam / Treatment Rooms at an annual throughput of 2,400 clinic 
stops each, minimum annual workload 480. Ranges 1 to 15 cover between 480 
and 72,000 clinic stops.

F. The SPCM metrics are translated into one (or more) Room Criteria Statement (RCS) for 
each room in Section 5 of this document. The SPCM Planning Range, the maximum 
number of directly workload-driven Exam / Treatment Rooms for both Ophthalmology 
and Optometry are 30 each. If a project shall require provision of workload driven 
rooms above the maximum range value refer to CFM for guidance. Rooms in this space 
planning document are organized in five Functional Areas (FAs) for Ophthalmology, five 
for Optometry and one for Optical Fitting. 
G. Based on its intended function, each room / space is assigned a: 
1. Room Name (RN), 
2. Room Code (RC), 
3. Room Area, the Net Square Feet (NSF) and its corresponding “soft metric” Net 
Square Meters (NSM), 
4. Unique Room Criteria Statement(s) (RCSs) correlated to answers to Input Data 
Statements (IDSs), and 
5. Room Comment as needed. 
H. The Room Codes included in this chapter stem from the VA Room Family. A unique 
support space, that may have variable area, is assigned a unique Room Code, and 
adopts the square footage, as needed, correlated to the room contents assigned which 
in turn correspond to the range for those rooms. A unique clinical space or a direct 
clinical support room, i.e., control room, system components room, etc. typically does 
not feature variable NSF. Patient Care room names for rooms unique to this chapter end 
in “, Eye Clnc”. Patient Care Support room names end in “, Bldg Sprt”, “Clncl Sprt”, “Stff 
Sprt”, or “, Vet Sprt”, correlating to Building, Clinical, Staff or Veteran Support room 
families. 
I. Section 5, Sub-Section F lists the SEPS Importer Shortcuts used for implementation of 
Sections 4 & 5 in SEPS. These shortcuts are inserted into the Room Criteria Statement 
(RCS) for each room which upon upload into the Space and Equipment Planning System 
(SEPS) allowing planners developing VA healthcare projects to determine quantity and 
square footage of each room by performing mathematical or logical calculations. 
Shortcuts refer Input Data Statements (IDSs), Rooms or calculation parameters 
stemming from the SPCM. 
J. SEPS is accessible to government healthcare planners and private sector consultants 
working on VA HC projects during their Period of Performance (PoP) through the 
MAX.gov website; government provided Training is a requisite for access. 
K. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross factor (NTDG) factor of 1.60 for Eye Clinic 
and a Building Gross factor of 1.35 in the space calculation to generate the Department 
Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross Square Feet (BGSF) respectively for the 
project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet (NSF) for each range. Planners 
can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the NTDG factor is fixed.

10 PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
O. General 
1. This chapter allocates Ophthalmology and Optometry clinic space separately in 
order to accommodate facilities that co-locate both services, facilities that provide 
Ophthalmology and Optometry services in separate areas within the facility, and 
facilities where only one service, either Ophthalmology or Optometry, are provided. 
2. The Program for Design (PFD) Report produced by SEPS based on these criteria is 
intended to be a baseline standardized space program in terms of the number of 
spaces provided for the clinic as well as their net square footage (NSF). Planner may 
make changes to PFD values for a project, provided reasoning is entered in the 
Comment field of each room affected for approval and approval is granted by 
reviewing government official; same principle applies to the Project Room Contents 
(PRC). 
3. Although Blind Rehabilitation Services are provided separately from VHA Eye Care 
Services, there is a close connection between both services and space allocated for 
Blind Rehabilitation may be provided within the clinic area. 
4. Create welcoming environments for patients and families by reducing 
environmental stressors. Daylighting, views of nature, gardens, indoor plants, and 
nature photography may alleviate patient anxiety, and provide positive distractions 
in waiting areas and treatment rooms. Consider physical layouts and design 
features that maximize non-institutional environmental aspects in order to provide 
a more therapeutic environment. 
5. Where possible, locate clinics proximate to public parking and the main facility 
entrance to improve access and minimize travel distance for patients with limited 
vision. 
6. Clearly define patient circulation and provide “visual queues” to facilitate ease of 
patient wayfinding. Create separate paths of travel where possible between 
patients and staff (“on stage” and “off stage”) to support privacy, safety and 
patient / staff satisfaction. 
7. Design the Eye Clinic: Ophthalmology and Optometry Services to provide access to 
patients with different levels of ability. It should be fully accessible and to support 
patient privacy, dignity. 
8. Comply with safety and ergonomics guidelines. 
9. Design for flexibility and adaptability to accommodate future expansion.

2 of 11 
1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines Space Planning Criteria for Chapter 234: Fiscal Service. It applies to 
all medical facilities at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
Fiscal Service is responsible for the hospital's financial activities including development of 
departmental budgets, maintenance of cost control systems, preparation of statistical 
reports, and managing disbursements and receipts Office. 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning system (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
234 – Fiscal Service 
3 of 11 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
234 – Fiscal Service 
4 of 11 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Fiscal Service 
Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as a basis for this chapter. The SPCM 
lists all the spaces a VA Fiscal Service site would require; the quantity and NSF for each 
room is calculated based on the number of FTE positions -all categories- authorized 
organized in eight ranges. Each range reflect five FTE positions authorized. 
B. The room quantity (Q) and area (NSF) values included in each range in the SPCM are 
reflected in the Room Criteria Statements, placed immediately below each room name, 
room code and NSF/NSM, for each room in Section 5 of this document. The number of 
Fiscal Service FTE positions authorized is included in the Input Data Statement in Section 
4. Both Sections are implemented in the Space Planning and Equipment System (SEPS) 
software accessible through the MAX.gov website. Planners programming a VA Fiscal 
Service project shall develop a baseline Program for Design (PFD) in SEPS. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
234 – Fiscal Service 
5 of 11 
C. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross (NTDG) factor of 1.30 for Fiscal Service 
and a Building Gross (BG) factor of 1.35 in the space calculation. These factors generate 
the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross Square Feet (BGSF) for 
the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet (NSF) for all Departments 
included. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the NTDG factor is fixed. 
D. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website.

2 of 9 
1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines Space Planning Criteria for Chapter 238: Medical Center Director 
Suite. It applies to all medical facilities at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
The Medical Center Director's Suite includes all administrative areas required by the 
Director, Assistant Director, Chief of Staff, and their immediate staffs (secretaries, 
management analysts, administrative assistants, and trainees). 
2. DEFINITIONS 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning system (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
238 – Medical Center Director’s Suite 
3 of 9 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs.  
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
238 – Medical Center Director’s Suite 
4 of 9 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
3. OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
1. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Medical 
Center Director’s Suite Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as a basis for 
this chapter. The SPCM lists all the spaces a VA Medical Center Director’s Suite would 
require; the quantity and NSF for each room is calculated based on the facility total 
number of FTE positions authorized organized in three ranges. 
2. The room quantity (Q) and area (NSF) values included in each range in the SPCM are 
reflected in the Room Criteria Statements, placed immediately below each room name, 
room code and NSF/NSM, for each room in Section 5 of this document. The number of 
facility FTE positions authorized is included in the Input Data Statements (IDSs) in 
Section 4. Both Sections are implemented in the Space Planning and Equipment System 
(SEPS) software accessible through the MAX.gov website. Planners programming a VA 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
238 – Medical Center Director’s Suite 
5 of 9 
Medical Center Director’s Suite project shall develop a baseline Program for Design 
(PFD) in SEPS. 
3. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross (NTDG) factor of 1.30 for Medical Center 
Director’s Suite and a Building Gross (BG) factor of 1.35 in the space calculation. These 
factors generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross 
Square Feet (BGSF) for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet 
(NSF) for all Departments included. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the 
NTDG factor is fixed. 
4. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website.

1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines the space planning criteria for Chapter 240: Pathology and 
Laboratory Medicine Service (PMLS). It applies to all medical facilities at the Department of 
Veterans Affairs (VA). 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center PMLS provides a wide range of clinical 
and anatomic pathology services which are necessary to carry out tests and procedures for 
diagnostic use in patient care. 
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Outpatient Clinics provide limited clinical 
laboratory services based on the need to screen for or monitor a disease process or to 
determine the need for hospitalization. Space Criteria for Outpatient Clinics are identified in 
Chapter 265. Specimens for more complex tests are collected, processed and forwarded to 
medical center laboratories for performance of the tests. 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Affiliated: An arrangement whereby a school of medicine agrees to partially staff a VA 
facility with faculty physicians, residents, and interns. In return, the VA provides the medical 
school with a venue to train new physicians. In this arrangement, the VA retains 
responsibility for the care of its patients while the school of medicine retains responsibility 
for all graduate level education and training. 
Anatomical Pathology: The branch of pathology dealing with the examination of tissue 
removed from the patient during surgery or an outpatient procedure. Anatomic pathology 
may include, but not limited to histology, cytology and autopsy. A frozen section laboratory 
is a subset of the histology Laboratory and is located in histology or for hospitals with a 
large volume of frozen sections in the surgical suite. Morgue operations are generally 
housed in a non-public area accessible to service vehicles. 
Automated Lab: A central area in the clinical laboratory that performs the high-volume, 
automated testing of hematology, coagulation, chemistry and urinalysis. 
Blood Bank: An area of PLMS that collects, processes, and stores blood and blood products 
for future use in transfusions and for other purposes. 
Chemistry: Consisting of general and automated chemistry, urinalysis, toxicology, and other 
special chemistry studies that detect or measure levels of elements, enzymes, hormones, 
vitamins, drugs, etc. within body fluids. 
Clinical Pathology: The branch of Pathology dealing with the examination and laboratory 
study of fluids (e.g. Blood) and other non-tissue specimens from patients. Among the many 
branches of clinical pathology are Chemistry, Hematology, Microbiology, Serology, 
Immunology, Urinalysis, and others. 
Coagulation: The section of the clinical laboratory that tests blood clotting capabilities; 
typically combined with hematology or the automated lab in most laboratories. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
240 – Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service 
3 of 30 
Cytology: The section of the clinical laboratory that studies cells for morphologic 
abnormalities indicative of disease. 
Frozen section: Part of histology, an area that performs immediate gross and microscopic 
evaluation of surgical specimens achieved by freezing the tissue, making a thin slice of a 
specimen, and studying that specimen under a microscope. The frozen section area is 
typically located within histology but is sometimes in the surgical suite. 
Gross pathology / tissue: The recognition of disease based on naked-eye examination of 
surgical specimens or at autopsy. The physical exam of a large specimen of body tissue to 
evaluate its conditions and the presence of disease. 
Hematology: The section of the clinical laboratory for the testing of blood samples. Includes 
manual, automated, and special hematology, serology, and coagulation (process of turning 
a liquid into a solid, especially blood clotting) to determine cell types, population counts, 
etc. 
Histology: The section of anatomic pathology that study of normal and diseased tissue by 
embedding them in paraffin blocks and then prepares slides from thin slices of the blocks. 
The slides are stained and then studied under a microscope. The blocks and slides must be 
stored for up to twenty five years. 
Immunology: The section of clinical pathology that studies the immune system’s stimulation 
by antigens. 
Laboratory Information System (LIS): The laboratory’s computer system and software. The 
LIS keeps track of all orders, specimens, quality control, and test results. It is typically 
interfaced with the hospitals information system and all automated lab equipment. 
Manual Laboratory: A section of the clinical laboratory that performs manual testing in 
chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis. It is usually located peripherally to the 
automated lab. 
Microbiology: The section of the clinical laboratory that may test for microorganisms 
including bacteria, viruses (virology), parasites (parasitology), fungi and fungus disease 
(mycology) and tuberculosis, along with other special organism studies related to the 
identification and quantification of organisms. 
Molecular Pathology: A section of the clinical laboratory that uses specialized techniques to 
evaluate disease at the molecular level. 
Morgue: An area specifically arranged and equipped for the study and storage of human 
remains. A morgue may or may not include an autopsy facility. 
Mycology: Part of microbiology, the area where specimens are tested for the presences of 
fungus. 
Point of Care Testing (POCT): Diagnostic clinical laboratory testing performed at or near the 
site of patient care rather than within the central laboratory. POCT mainly uses hand held or 
small instruments for immediate testing at the patient’s bedside or outpatient location. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
240 – Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service 
4 of 30 
Workspace is required in the central laboratory for quality assurance and monitoring of 
POCT and filing of maintenance records. 
Reference or Referral Laboratory: A Laboratory that performs tests sent from outside 
entities. Reference labs are used by laboratories that do not have the instrumentation or 
capability to perform a specific test. 
Serology: A section of the clinical laboratory that performs immunology tests. Serology is 
usually not a stand-alone section; it could be located in several sections of clinical 
pathology. 
Specimen Processing (Accessioning): The receiving, verifying, logging, and preparing of 
specimens for distribution to the appropriate testing area in the laboratory. 
Urinalysis: A section of the clinical laboratory where urine analysis is performed. This area is 
usually located in the chemistry area. 
Virology: Typically, a part of microbiology where specimens are tested for the presence of 
viruses. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set

that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs.  
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project.

SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Pathology 
and Laboratory Medicine Service Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as a 
basis for this chapter. The SPCM lists all the spaces a VA Pathology and Laboratory 
Medicine Service site would require; the quantity and NSF for each room is calculated 
based on the Level -S, M, L & VL- authorized organized in four ranges. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
240 – Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service 
7 of 30 
B. The room quantity (Q) and area (NSF) values included in each range in the SPCM are 
reflected in the Room Criteria Statements, placed immediately below each room name, 
room code and NSF/NSM, for each room in Section 5 of this document. The Pathology 
and Laboratory Medicine Service Level authorized is included in the Input Data 
Statements (IDSs) in Section 4. Both Sections are implemented in the Space Planning 
and Equipment System (SEPS) software accessible through the MAX.gov website. 
Planners programming a VA Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service project shall 
develop a baseline Program for Design (PFD) in SEPS. 
C. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross (NTDG) factor of 1.50 for Pathology and 
Laboratory Medicine Service and a Building Gross (BG) factor of 1.35 in the space 
calculation. These factors generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the 
Building Gross Square Feet (BGSF) for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net 
Square Feet (NSF) for all Departments included. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in 
SEPS; the NTDG factor is fixed. 
D. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website. 
E. Laboratory space allocation must be based on multiple criteria. Factors to be considered 
would include overall laboratory workload [reflected in data reported in the Laboratory 
Management Index Program (LMIP)], the number of FTE assigned to the lab, the Medical 
Complexity Grouping (MCG) of the facility in which the Laboratory will be located, and 
the variety and complexity of services to be offered by the laboratory. All of these 
factors should be used to assess and determine the space needs of the Pathology and 
Laboratory Medicine Service with respect to a given facility. No single factor is 
predominant over the others. Rather it is more relevant to compose a composite profile 
of the proposed laboratory using all available data. 
F. For planning purposes, the proposed laboratory can be projected into one of four (4) 
“Levels”. As stated, the assignment of a “Level” to a proposed laboratory must be based 
on the assessment of multiple factors. No single factor is predominant. The following 
laboratory level categories are used in this document to allocate space: 
1. Level S (small): Annual LMIP workload of less than 250,000 tests, facility MCG of 3, 
less than 20 Laboratory FTEs, basic chemistry, hematology, microbiology, etc. 
services performed. 
2. Level M (medium): Annual LMIP workload of 250,000 to 500,000 tests, facility 
MCG of 2, 20 to 40 Laboratory FTEs, more advanced chemistry, hematology, 
microbiology, and other clinical laboratory services performed. 
3. Level L (large): Annual LMIP workload of 500,000 to 1.5 million tests, facility MCG of 
1c or 1b, greater than 40 Laboratory FTE, advanced and complex chemistry, 
hematology, microbiology, and other clinical laboratory services performed. May 
provide specialized and reference laboratory services to other VA Medical Centers 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
240 – Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service 
8 of 30 
and the community. 
4. Level VL (very large): Annual LMIP workload of greater than 1.5 million tests, 
facility MCG of 1b or 1a, greater than 40 Laboratory FTE, advanced and complex 
chemistry, hematology, microbiology, and other clinical laboratory services 
performed. May provide specialized and reference laboratory services to other VA 
Medical Centers and the community. 
G. In the design of a clinical laboratory, a determination of the required square footage is 
only the beginning. The use of average figures for all laboratories is misleading, tends to 
perpetuate existing designs and to prevent innovation. The use of average figures is not 
a form of laboratory planning, but rather is something that is done instead of planning 
intended primarily to provide a basis for estimating construction costs. The criteria for 
each laboratory section are intended to provide flexibility so that space will be planned 
based on the need to respond to the medical center's patient care programs. The 
number of square feet (meters) for each laboratory section are considered adequate for 
normal operations but may be modified during program and conceptual development if 
adequately justified. 
H. The following factors concerning space determinations should be taken into 
consideration: 
1. The instrumentation required to perform the test menu in the laboratory, and the 
degree of automation, is the key driver of space. In the automated lab, a very large 
volume of tests can be performed on one analyzer run by one staff member — test 
volume and staffing are not generally used to determine the amount of space 
required for Laboratory operations in automated areas. The degree of automation 
has a significant impact on both the space and configuration of the laboratory. One 
new automated instrument often consolidates several manual workstations or 
individual instruments. Automation is taking tremendous strides — every year; 
more tests are available on automated analyzers, reducing the number of staff 
needed in technical areas and giving laboratories the capability to perform esoteric 
tests that they could not provide in the past. 
2. In highly manual areas, where automation is not yet developed, there is more 
correlation between test volume, staffing, and space. These areas include 
histology, microbiology, and the blood bank. Even in these areas, new technology is 
being developed to automate specific processes — within the next five to ten 
years; additional automation will change the facility requirements for these 
Laboratory sections as well. This document assumes for planning purposes that 
automation will not require any of these areas to be larger than they are currently. 
3. Laboratory work area space for medium and larger laboratories includes space for 
the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and non-Department of Veterans Affairs 
(VA) medical technology student/pathology resident training. 
4. Laboratory work area space for all VA laboratories includes refrigerated and non- 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022

9 of 30 
refrigerated storage space for several days' supply of reagents, control, stains,

This functional area is required when the laboratory performs specialized testing 
requiring the extraction, hybridization, amplification, or other analysis of nucleic acids to 
diagnose disease, predict the prognosis of disease, guide therapy, or evaluate the 
susceptibility to disease before disease is evident. Given the high potential for 
contamination during the assay process, laboratory space must be designed to minimize 
the risk of contamination. Barrier containment through the use of physically separate 
work areas is required. Laboratory space must also be adequate for the installation of 
biologic safety cabinets, laminar flow hoods, ultra-low temperature freezers, and other 
required equipment. Other engineering requirements such as negative air flow also 
apply.

6 SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA – OUTPATIENT CLINIC LABORATORY 
Refer to Chapter 265: Outpatient / PACT Clinic Functional Area 14: Pathology and 
Laboratory Medicine (PLM) Service. 
7 PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. Laboratories should be designed to meet changing requirements. Changes in laboratory 
requirements/new technology dictate flexibility or adaptability of design to patterns of 
laboratory workflow, deletion of certain procedures and addition of others. Adaptability 
in interior space means that even walls should be movable in areas where expansion is 
likely to occur, or workload is likely to alter space requirements due to changes in 
technology. 
B. In new construction the laboratory may be arranged in a radial pattern with or without 
subdivision into the traditional disciplines. Rapid turnaround time equipment 
(Automated Processing areas in Clinical Pathology work area) should be co-located to 
provide Immediate Response testing, with other equipment located toward the 
periphery. The more distant portions of the laboratory should be closed off after the 
daily routine is completed, and work should be clustered near the specimen 
accessioning and Automated Processing areas to provide a more efficient workflow for 
technical staff during non-routine hours. 
C. If the main laboratory is physically located on the same floor as the ambulatory care 
area, only one Specimen Collection area is necessary, and it should be located within the 
main laboratory layout to provide efficiency and reduce staffing. If the main laboratory 
cannot be located convenient to the ambulatory care entrance, then a Satellite Patient 
Specimen Collection Area should be provided with a small after hours Specimen 
Collection area in the main laboratory. If a Satellite Specimen Collection Areas is 
required it should be located convenient to the ambulatory care areas and patient 
entrance as possible. If located in the main laboratory the patient specimen collection 
area should be located to prevent patient from contact with the Core Laboratory work 
areas. 
D. The specimen processing (accessioning) area should be located at or near the entrance 
to be used by phlebotomists and/or other staff bringing laboratory specimens to the 
laboratory. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022

E. Chemistry, Special Chemistry, Hematology, Urinalysis, and Coagulation have highly 
automated instrumentation processes and manual processes. It is desirable to centralize 
the automated processing areas of these departments to allow significantly greater 
efficiency and faster turnaround time than would be achievable if each of these sections 
were separately located and staffed. This area performs tests as soon as they arrive in 
the laboratory so there is no need for a separate Immediate Response Laboratory when 
this configuration is deployed. If a Pneumatic Tube system is approved one station 
should be located in this area. 
F. It is particularly important that the service oriented (diagnostic) Electron Microscopy 
Suite be located in close proximity to the frozen and gross section laboratory. It must be 
integrated with the location of the Immunopathology Laboratory in the Clinical 
Diagnostic Area; and should not be isolated in a research area which is at some distance 
from the diagnostic anatomic pathology service. The suite should not be located near 
anything producing vibrations. Similarly, location near high voltage electrical equipment 
should be avoided. Since electron microscopes generate an excessive amount of heat, 
adequate air flow and temperature control is essential in the scope room. Adequate 
ventilation should be provided. 
G. Administrative space and storage are considered “clean” areas; laboratory and 
processing space are considered “dirty.” Since Laboratory coats must be worn in the 
dirty areas and cannot be worn in the clean areas, it is helpful to develop a clean / dirty 
interface that employees must walk through to go from one area to the other. This 
interface should be a room with hooks on the wall to hang Laboratory coats, a storage 
cabinet for clean Laboratory coats, and a hand washing sink. Administrative, education / 
training, and clerical staff space should be located at the periphery of the laboratory, 
separate from testing areas, but still accessible to the staff. 
H. Morgue operations are generally housed in a non-public area accessible to service 
vehicles; the morgue does not need to be located near the laboratory. 
I. The employee entrance to the laboratory should be near the staff locker / changing 
rooms. 
J. Refer to PG-18-1, Master Construction Specifications, for special considerations in 
design that must be given to electrical, air-conditioning, ventilation, and mechanical 
aspects of laboratory construction. 
K. Gas, air and vacuum are no longer required in Chemistry and Hematology. Gas may still 
be required in some Microbiology Laboratories. Fixed gas, air vacuum outlets are no 
longer needed at the work stations and should be eliminated since they are seldom 
used. Where needed, vacuum and air may be supplied by small portable pumps and gas 
may be supplied in small pressurized cylinders. 
L. Critical Clearances: 
1. Provide a minimum of 1525 mm (5') between laboratory work benches. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
240 – Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service 
29 of 30 
2. Provide a minimum of 1525 mm (5') between the end of a Laboratory work bench 
and the nearest piece of equipment. 
M. Consideration should be given to the effects of building vibration, as building vibration 
could interfere with the accuracy of patient testing. 
N. Refer to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management Technical Information Library (www.cfm.va.gov/til/) for additional 
technical criteria.

1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines space planning criteria for Chapter 244: Lobby. It applies to all 
medical facilities at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
Lobby space defined in this chapter is for the single, main medical center entrance. Lobby 
spaces for Outpatient Clinics are programmed in the VA265 Community Based Outpatient 
Clinic (CBOC) chapter. 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Space Planning. / SEPS 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning system (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
244 – Lobby 
3 of 8 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs.  
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
244 – Lobby

This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Lobby Space 
Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as a basis for this chapter. The SPCM lists all 
the spaces a VA Lobby site would require; the quantity and NSF for each room is 
calculated based on facility number of patient beds -all types- organized in five ranges, 
each corresponding to 100 patient beds incrementally. 
B. The room quantity (Q) and area (NSF) values calculated for each range in the SPCM are 
reflected in the Room Criteria Statements, placed immediately below each room name, 
room code and NSF/NSM, for each room in Section 5 of this document. The number of 
facility patient beds is included in the Input Data Statements (IDSs) in Section 4. Both 
Sections are implemented in the Space Planning and Equipment System (SEPS) software 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
244 – Lobby 
5 of 8 
accessible through the MAX.gov website. Planners programming a VA Lobby project 
shall develop a baseline Program for Design (PFD) in SEPS. 
C. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross (NTDG) factor of 1.20 for Lobby and a 
Building Gross (BG) factor of 1.35 in the space calculation. These factors generate the 
Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross Square Feet (BGSF) for the 
project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet (NSF) for all Departments 
included. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the NTDG factor is fixed. 
D. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website.

1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines Space Planning Criteria for Chapter 246: Health Administration 
Service (HAS). It applies to all medical facilities at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
The Health Administration Service (HAS) was previously referred to as Medical 
Administration Service (MAS). The organizational alignment of the functions noted in this 
chapter may vary from VHA facility to VHA facility. For example, some may also be aligned 
under a Business Office Service or under a Fiscal Service. It may also be that some of the 
offices mentioned may be assigned to another medical facility service. These criteria 
allocate space for each function and allow for flexibility with respect to the location of that 
space within a facility based on the specific requirements of that facility. 
The Veterans Health Administration’s Chief Business Office (CBO) is VHA’s national focal 
point and the single accountable authority for the development of administrative processes, 
policy, regulations, and directives associated with the delivery of VA health benefit 
programs. As a principal health benefits administration advisor to the Under Secretary for 
Health, the Chief Business Officer develops, implements, and supports various aspects of 
administrative health care issues. This includes supporting most activities referred to in this 
chapter. The CBO is organized into offices that include business Development, Information, 
Operations, and Policy. CBO is also composed of independent offices in the field, dedicated 
to health benefits administration and revenue-related programs: Health Administration 
Center (Denver), Health Eligibility Center (Atlanta), Health Revenue Center (Topeka), and 
Compensation and Pension Exam Program (Nashville). Program managers at these activities 
may also be of assistance to field activities for guidance and recommendations concerning 
the application of space criteria in VHA facilities. 
The Health Administration Service Program at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) 
medical center level includes a multiplicity of administrative / clerical functions including 
medical records management, telephone switchboard operation, and mail handling; 
essential to the effective, overall management of inpatient and outpatient care. This 
program generally consists of functions performed in the following major organizational 
activities: 
1. Office of the Chief 
2. Health Benefits Section: Centralized Registration Unit 
3. Health Benefits Section: Outpatient Registration 
4. Emergency Care Area (ER) 
5. Health Information Management Section 
6. Fee Services Section 
7. Medical Care Cost Recovery (MCCR) Section 
8. Ward Administration Section 
9. Office Operations Section 
Refer to the following Space Planning Criteria chapters to determine space requirements for 
the following:

2 DEFINITIONS 
Administrative Personnel: Administrative personnel are all personnel who do not counsel, 
diagnosis, examine or treat patients, but who do work that is essential for the 
accomplishment of the mission of a medical treatment facility. This does include military 
(assigned and borrowed), contract and civilian personnel. It does not include volunteers. 
AMIS: Acronym for Automated Medical Information System. 
Bed Control Clerk, Patient Services Assistant and Administrative Officer of the Day: Staff 
members who interview patients being admitted to the hospital or Medical Center and who 
create the inpatient record and all documents necessary for the admission. 
Cashier: Employee responsible for receiving, holding, and disbursing cash to and from 
hospital or Medical Center patients because of diagnostic care or treatment. 
Centralized Registration Unit: For the purposes of these criteria, denotes spaces for integral 
administrative functions of the main Hospital. Administrative functions include: 
1. Fee Services Section which manages budget execution; funding control; voucher control; 
and billing activities with State and community Nursing Home programs. 
2. Medical Care Cost Recovery (MCCR) Section is responsible for the cost recovery of VA 
Medical Care funds from third party health insurance providers. 
3. Medical information services such as FOIA; bed control; patient transfers; and patient 
support. 
Decedent Affairs Clerk: Employee responsible for the administrative details (survivor 
counseling, paperwork, and notifications) incidental to the death of a patient.

Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Health 
Administration Service Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as a basis for 
this chapter. The SPCM lists all the spaces a VA Health Administration Service site would 
require; the quantity and NSF for each room is calculated based on the facility total 
number of FTE positions authorized organized in three ranges each corresponding to at 
least 1,000 FTE positions incrementally. 
B. The room quantity (Q) and area (NSF) values included for each range in the SPCM are 
reflected in the Room Criteria Statements, placed immediately below each room name, 
room code and NSF/NSM, for each room in Section 5 of this document. The number of 
facility total number of FTE positions authorized is included in the Input Data 
Statements (IDSs) in Section 4. Both Sections are implemented in the Space Planning 
and Equipment System (SEPS) software accessible through the MAX.gov website. 
Planners programming a VA Health Administration Service project shall develop a 
baseline Program for Design (PFD) in SEPS. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022

8 of 21 
C. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross (NTDG) factor of 1.30 for Health 
Administration Service and a Building Gross (BG) factor of 1.35 in the space calculation. 
These factors generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building 
Gross Square Feet (BGSF) for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square 
Feet (NSF) for all Departments included. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the 
NTDG factor is fixed. 
D. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website. 
E. The Health Administration Service (HAS) at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) 
medical center level includes a multiplicity of administrative / clerical functions essential 
to the effective, overall management of inpatient and outpatient care. 
F. Patient Records: Patient records in VA facilities will be created, managed, and stored in 
a manner which maintains patient privacy. The current standard for maintaining patient 
records utilize the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS). For additional

direct patient care, continuing education, training, patient health education, research and 
public relations. MMS ensures the medical center needs are met in the areas of 
Photography, Illustration, Electronic Graphic Design and Publishing, Video / Sound 
Recording, CCTV and LAN, Video Distribution, and Copy Center Reproduction and Finishing. 
This document includes the following requirements for operations to address all possible 
options available through Medical Media Services in the VA Health Care System: 
A. Core Criteria Medical Media Service (MMS), 
B. Expanded Core Criteria Medical Media Service (ECMM), 
C. Medical Media VISN Support Site (MMVSS), 
D. VAMC without Medical Media Services. 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Audiovisual (AV) Services: These services are provided to record patient medical 
procedures, educational events, and interviews. Additional uses include, but are not limited 
to, documentation, education, review, and analysis. Post-production is provided to 
organize, enhance and/or improve the finished product. 
Central Copy Center Service: Provides some high volume, high speed copying, printing and 
some finishing services for the Medical Center. With this level of service some 
reproduction/printing and finishing work would be contracted out to off-site vendors. 
Core Program (MMS) Requirements: The Minimum program requirements for Department 
of Veteran’s Affairs health care facilities without an active university affiliation. See Medical 
Media Services below. 
Expanded Central Copy Center Service: A copy / reproduction service that provides all high 
volume, high speed copying, printing and all finishing services for the Medical Center. 
Expanded Core Program (MMEC) Requirements: Additional program requirements that will 
normally be instituted at university affiliated medical centers. The range and size of the 
educational programs provided, and the extent of available VISN support and/or sharing of 
facilities with affiliated medical schools will influence the additional programs provided. 
Expanded core requirements include the same functions as Core program (MMS) with 
larger space allowances to accommodate increased production volumes, and flexibility in 
response to more complex media requirements of the academic environment. Expanded 
Core Requirements must be justified at a nonaffiliated medical center with appropriate 
personnel and program need. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022

prints, negatives, transparencies and a variety of digital files. Subjects may include, but are 
not limited to, patient, clinical, surgical and autopsy procedures, equipment, radiographs, 
illustrations, charts and graphs. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
248 – Medical Media Service 
4 of 19 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning system (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
248 – Medical Media Service 
5 of 19 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Medical 
Media Service Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as a basis for this 
chapter. The SPCM lists all the spaces a VA Medical Media Service site would require; 
the quantity and NSF for each room is calculated based on type of Medical Media 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
248 – Medical Media Service 
6 of 19 
Service authorized organized in ten ranges. Medical Media Services (MMS) Program, 
Medical Media Expanded Core (MMEC) Program and Medical Media VISN Support each 
are assigned three ranges, S, M & L correlated to the number of MMS FTE positions 
authorized in each in increments of five. The last range is used for facilities a full service 
MMS is not authorized. 
B. The room quantity (Q) and area (NSF) values included for each range in the SPCM are 
reflected in the Room Criteria Statements, placed immediately below each room name, 
room code and NSF/NSM, for each room in Section 5 of this document. The number of 
Medical Media Service FTE positions authorized and the program ty authorized are 
included in the Input Data Statements (IDSs) in Section 4. Both Sections are 
implemented in the Space Planning and Equipment System (SEPS) software accessible 
through the MAX.gov website. Planners programming a VA Medical Media Service 
project shall develop a baseline Program for Design (PFD) in SEPS. 
C. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross (NTDG) factor of 1.30 for Medical Media 
Service and a Building Gross (BG) factor of 1.35 in the space calculation. These factors 
generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross Square Feet 
(BGSF) for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet (NSF) for all 
Departments included. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the NTDG factor is 
fixed. 
D. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website.

8 PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. Medical Media Services may be located either in the main clinical building or in a 
building that is directly adjacent to the main clinical building. If MMS is located in a 
separate building the following considerations must be met: The building must be 
directly adjacent to the main clinical building and connected by an enclosed causeway 
that has regulated heating / air conditioning. Access by patients must be easy and 
simple with no disruption to other services. MMS staff must have access to all surgical 
suites within a 15 minute walking period. 
B. The Photo Studio must be easily accessible from the elevators serving the nursing units. 
Soundproofing is required to support audiovisual recording activities, thus isolating this 
area from noise which may be produced from adjacent services and air handling 
systems. 
C. All Audiovisual Recording, Narration, Control and Editing Rooms as well as the Client 
Review Room require soundproofing, thus isolating this area from noise which may be 
produced from adjacent services and air handling systems. 
D. Medical Media must be isolated from structural vibrations such as elevators and 
building mechanical systems which cause distortion in all photographic, illustration, and 
audiovisual recording reproduction. 
E. Medical Media must be free from outside radiation interference such as radio frequency 
and magnetic interference which can erase or cause image and sound distortion during 
the production. 
F. Photography and illustration areas require 100% fresh air and 100% air exhaust. 
G. The Photo / Audiovisual Recording Studio requires a minimum ceiling height of 12’-0” 
for ceiling track lighting systems and floor standing lighting hardware and accessories. 
The location selected must provide reasonable access by patients with direct, double 
door access from a medical center corridor for patients on litters or beds as well as large 
pieces of equipment or props used in productions. A minimum room length of 30’-0” 
must be planned to accommodate videotaping. Additional electrical power is required 
to accommodate studio lighting for video recording. 
H. Audiovisual Control and Editing Rooms require either raised flooring or a service chase 
to cover the multitude of electrical cords of varying sizes and lengths used to connect 
hardware. Climate control should be considered for CCTV Control Rooms. Area should 
be kept free of moisture and temperature should be kept cool. 
I. Emergency power should be provided for MATV / CCTV Headend for signal distribution 
during an emergency. 
J. Refer to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management Technical Information Library (www.cfm.va.gov/til/) for additional 
technical criteria.

2 of 11 
1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines Space Planning Criteria for Chapter 254: Nursing Service 
Administration. It applies to all medical facilities at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning system (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
254 – Nursing Service Administration 
3 of 11 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
254 – Nursing Service Administration 
4 of 11 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Nursing 
Service Administration Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as a basis for 
this chapter. The SPCM lists all the spaces a VA Nursing Service Administration site 
would require; the quantity and NSF for each room is calculated based on Nursing 
Service Administration number of FTE positions authorized organized in four ranges 
each corresponding to fifteen FTE positions authorized each incrementally. 
B. The room quantity (Q) and area (NSF) values included for each range in the SPCM are 
reflected in the Room Criteria Statements, placed immediately below each room name, 
room code and NSF/NSM, for each room in Section 5 of this document. The number of 
Nursing Service Administration FTE positions authorized is included in the Input Data 
Statements (IDSs) in Section 4. Both Sections are implemented in the Space Planning 
and Equipment System (SEPS) software accessible through the MAX.gov website. 
Planners programming a VA Nursing Service Administration project shall develop a 
baseline Program for Design (PFD) in SEPS. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
254 – Nursing Service Administration 
5 of 11 
C. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross (NTDG) factor of 1.30 for Nursing Service 
Administration and a Building Gross (BG) factor of 1.35 in the space calculation. These 
factors generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross 
Square Feet (BGSF) for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet 
(NSF) for all Departments included. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the 
NTDG factor is fixed. 
D. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website.

D. SEPS IMPORTER SHORTCUTS 
The following shortcuts are used in the Room Criteria Statements in the Nursing Service 
Administration Functional Areas. These shortcuts are used during upload of this 
document into the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) software during 
implementation of the space planning parameters contained herewith to allow for 
mathematical or logical calculations to be performed. Input Data Statements (IDSs), 
Rooms or a partial calculation formula can have a shortcut. 
1. total number of FTE positions authorized for this facility: [How many total FTE 
positions are authorized for this facility?] 
6 PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. Centralize check-in/check-out for more efficient use of staff. 
B. Space saving systems furniture will be used wherever possible 
C. Administrative Conference Room - At any hospital, Nursing Service accounts for 30 
percent to 40 percent of the total FTEE. It is difficult to schedule the hospital's 
conference room because the Medical Center Director has scheduling priority and all 
other hospital services also have need of the room. The Training Room already included 
in these criteria is in constant use for the educational requirements for 600 to 800 
people, e.g., CPR training and 10 or 11 mandatory classes per employee per year in 
areas of fire and safety, patient abuse and assaultive behavior. With a staff as large as 
nursing service, there are always management and personnel functions which must be 
frequently supported. 
D. Refer to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management Technical Information Library (www.cfm.va.gov/til/) for additional 
technical criteria.

2. DEFINITIONS 
Airborne Transmission: infection spread through exposure to those virus-containing 
respiratory droplets comprised of smaller droplets and particles that can remain suspended 
in the air over long distances (usually greater than 6 feet) and time (typically hours). 
Automated Supply Dispensing Unit (ASDU): Automated supply or medication dispensing and 
inventory control systems. 
Class (Imaging Room): Designation of an imaging room based on the level of intervention / 
acuity it is intended to support, with Class 1 being low-acuity diagnostic, Class 2 being 
higher-acuity diagnostic or interventional, and Class 3 being intraoperative. 
Computed Tomography (CT): A CT scan, or computed tomography scan is a medical imaging 
procedure that uses computer-processed combinations of many X-ray measurements taken 
from different angles to produce cross-sectional (tomographic) images (virtual "slices") of 
specific areas of a scanned object, allowing the user to see inside the object. 
Direct Line of Sight: A direct, unobstructed, line of sight from a clinician to a patient, which 
is essential for suicide prevention. 
Emergency Department (ED): An ED is a Service that provides resuscitative therapy and 
stabilization in life threatening situations. It is staffed and equipped to provide initial 
evaluation, treatment, and disposition for a broad spectrum of illnesses, injuries, and 
psychiatric disorders, regardless of the level of severity. Care is provided in a clearly defined 
area dedicated to the ED and operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (24/7).

Emergency Department Integration Software (EDIS): The patient “tracking” system that is 
used in VA emergency departments across the country. This interfaces with the CPRS or 
CERNER electronic health record system. 
Emergency Medical Services (EMS): EMS is a type of Emergency Service dedicated to 
providing out-of-hospital Acute medical care and/or transport to definitive care, to patients 
with illnesses and injuries which the patient, or the medical practitioner, believes 
constitutes a medical emergency. 
Exam / Treatment Room (E/T Rm): An ED patient room used for a variety of functions 
including patient examination and various treatments or procedures; this room is sized and 
equipped based on the specific clinical function it is intended to support. The following E/T 
Rms are included in this document: General, Fast-Track, Airborne Infection Isolation, Mental 
Health, Bariatric, GYN and Protective Environment. Additionally, Eye/ENT and Orthopedic 
Treatment Rooms are also included. 
Fast-Track: A patient area within the emergency department, used to limit overcrowding 
and reduce patients’ waiting times. Patients with low acuity needing minimal resources are 
commonly referred here, allowing these patients to move more quickly through the 
department and providing separation from patients requiring a higher level of care and 
longer care times. 
First Look: A term utilized to identify a clinical staff member who initially observes the 
patient entering the facility through the walk-in entrance, usually as part of the 
triage/assessment and sorting function upon patient arrival. 
Imaging Services: The medical specialty that utilizes imaging examinations with or without 
ionizing radiation to affect diagnosis or guide treatment. Techniques used in the Emergency 
Department include radiography, and computed tomography (CT) imaging. 
Imaging Room: Designated room containing diagnostic equipment performing patient 
procedures such as radiography, ultrasound, and computed tomography (CT). 
Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS): A system designed for the digital 
capture, transfer, storage, and evaluation of medical images. 
Resuscitation: The restoration of consciousness to a person whose respirations had 
temporarily ceased. 
Sally Port: A secure, controlled walk-in entry way into the mental health unit of an 
emergency department. Typically, an enclosed room where no more than one door can be 
opened at a time, used for searching walk-in mental health patients before they enter a 
secured mental health unit within the emergency department. 
Triage: The process of determining the priority of patients’ treatments by the severity of 
their condition or likelihood of recovery with and without treatment. 
Ultrasound: Diagnostic ultrasound, also called sonography or diagnostic medical 
sonography, is an imaging method that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce 
images of structures within your body.

VA Medical Center (VAMC): A VA hospital facility that provides a diverse range of health 
care services to Veterans. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Accessible: A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with provisions outlined 
in the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA). 
Architectural Barriers Act (ABA): A set of standards developed to ensure that all buildings 
financed with federal funds are designed and constructed to be fully accessible to everyone. 
This law requires all construction, renovation, or leasing of sites, facilities, buildings, and 
other elements, financed with federal funds, to comply with the Architectural Barriers Act 
Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). The ABAAS replaces the Uniform Federal Accessibility 
Standards (UFAS). 
Average Length of Encounter (ALoE): Averaged length of time, in minutes, a patient spends 
in an Exam / Treatment Room interacting with a provider and the clinical support team. It is 
accounted from room “set-up” to “clean-up” by staff. This metric is used to determine the 
number of annual patient / provider encounters that take place in an Exam / Treatment 
Room which, in turn, is used to calculate the number of Exam / Treatment Rooms needed in 
a facility based on projected annual workload. The ALoE is determined with VHA SME input 
during a PG-18-9 clinical chapter revision / update. 
Average Length of Stay (ALoS): The average number of days a patient Veteran stays in an 
inpatient care unit. The ALoS is used to calculate the number of patient bedrooms for a 
specialty by dividing the site’s projected workload by the ALoS. 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Clinic Stop: Per these criteria, a clinic stop is the workload unit of measure for space 
planning. Clinic Stops are codified by VSSC, when applicable, they are referenced by number 
in the calculation of workload driven patient care spaces in this document. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Encounter: An interaction between a patient Veteran and a VA provider or providers in an 
Exam Room / Treatment Room / Consultation Room / Procedure Room, spaces where a 
patient Veteran received clinical care. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
256 – Emergency Department (ED) 
5 of 49 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Patient Unique: (or Unique Patient), A Veteran patient counted as a unique in each division 
from which they receive care. Patient Uniques are included in the Registry for a VA Medical 
Center. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022

The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Provider: An individual who examines, diagnoses, treats, prescribes medication, and 
manages the care of patients within his or her scope of practice as established by the 
governing body of a healthcare organization. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
Room Efficiency Factor: A factor that provides flexibility in the utilization of a room to 
account for patient delays, scheduling conflicts, and equipment maintenance. Common 
factors are in the 75% to 85% range. A room with 80% room efficiency provides a buffer to 
assume that this room would be available 20% of the time beyond the planned operational 
practices for this room. This factor may be adjusted based on the actual and/or anticipated 
operations and processes of the room/department at a particular facility. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022

7 of 49 
Stop Code: A measure of workload including clinic stops forecasted by the Office of Policy 
and Planning (OPP) for all Strategic Planning Categories at Medical Center and Outpatient 
Clinic levels. 
Telehealth: The use of technology, such as computers and mobile devices, to manage 
healthcare remotely. It includes a variety of health care services, including but not limited to 
online support groups, online health information and self-management tools, email and 
online communication with health care providers, remote monitoring of vital signs, video, 
or online doctor visits. Depending on the concept of operations for this space, it may be 
equipped as an exam room or as a consult room with video/camera capability. 
Utilization Rate: A factor used in the calculation of a directly workload-driven room 
throughput. It represents, in a percent value, the room is idle based on the planning 
assumptions. For example, if a directly workload-driven room is available for use 8 hours a 
day, the Utilization Rate represents the assumed time it will be used, an 85% utilization rate 
indicates, for planning purposes, the room will be used 6.8 hours a day. An additional 
directly workload-driven room will be provided in the calculation once the previous room 
has reached 100% utilization. The utilization Rate is embedded in the Room Throughput 
value calculated in Section 3 of this document. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
Workstation: Area outfitted with equipment and furnishings, typically allocated 56 NSF 
each. Managers and other staff with no direct reports as well as part-time, seasonal, and 
job-sharing staff may qualify for a workstation. Such environments are particularly 
conducive to team-oriented office groupings. These environments work best when they 
have access to conference and small group meeting spaces.

3. OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the ED Space 
Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed with participation of VA ED SMEs, VA CFM 
personnel and Consultants during the space planning and design standards update 
process. The ED SPCM lists all the spaces a VA ED site would require based on its 
projected workload for 48 Exam / Treatment Room ranges. 
B. Room quantity and area (NSF) for every room in each of the 48 E/T Rm ranges is 
determined in the ED SPCM. These values are reflected in the Room Criteria Statements 
(placed immediately below each room name, room code and NSF/NSM) for each room 
in Section 5 of this document. Each range represents an annual ED E/T Rm throughput 
of 1,051 patients; space planning criteria herein developed cover a projected workload 
of between 840 and 50,448 annual ED encounters. The 48 ranges are subdivided in four 
Modules of 12 E/T Rms each. 
C. VSSC’s EMMT EDIS FY15-19 Report for 111 High, Medium and Low Complexity sites was 
used to develop the ranges covering the workload demand of the existing VA ED sites as 
well as for potential future larger facilities. 
D. Annual ED E/T Room Throughput has been determined based on the following 
parameters: 
1. Target VA Emergency Department Average Length of Encounter (ALoE) = 200 mins. 
2. Number of operating days / year: 365 
3. High demand daily hours of operation: 12 (720 mins.) 
4. Resulting annual E/T Room throughput (at 100%): 1,314 encounters 
5. Adopted annual E/T Room throughput (at 80% Utilization Rate): 1,051 encounters 
E. The ED SPCM range values are available to planners in the Space and Equipment 
Planning System (SEPS) software hosted at MAX.gov. Sections 4 and 5 of this Program 
Guide are implemented in SEPS. Space planners working on VA ED projects can generate 
a Program for Design (PFD) by entering the projected Stop Code 130 workload for the 
target year for the VA Station they are working on. The PFD generated by SEPS reflects 
the values in the SPCM and becomes the baseline space program to begin the project 
planning process. 
For example: 
A SC130 projection of 6,800 annual encounters corresponds to seven E/T Rooms; eight 
E/T Rooms will be generated. 
A SC130 projection of 24,175 annual encounters will generate twenty-four E/T Rooms. 
F. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross factor (NTDG) factor of 1.65 and a 
Building Gross factor of 1.35 in the space calculation to generate the Department Gross 
Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross Square Feet (BGSF) respectively for the 
project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet (NSF) for each range. Planners 
can adjust the BG factor in SEPS; the DG factor is not changeable. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
256 – Emergency Department (ED) 
9 of 49 
G. SEPS also generates the Project Room Contents (PRC) for each room in the project. The 
PRC includes the equipment, furniture and fixtures assigned to each room per VA256 ED 
PG-18-5: Equipment Guidelist. 
H. PG-18-12: Design Guide contains a Narrative, detailed functional diagrams, and detailed 
room templates for sixteen unique ED rooms. 
I. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-5, PG-18-9 and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website. 
J. Assignment of the resulting workload generated E/T Rms for a project is done by range 
based on Tables 1 and 2 below. 
A. Cols (1) and (2): Workload values for each range. 
B. Col (3): Module generated 
C. Col (4): Number of workload driven ED E/T Rms generated.

The fast-track system at the emergency department is similar to urgent care. 
Patients who are triaged (or sorted) into the fast-track system typically come in with 
lower acuity complaints like a sore throat, a rash, urinary tract infections, and minor 
injuries. Most of the time, patients that go to fast-track are generally healthy, and 
their complaints can be diagnosed through a history, physical, and x-ray or point of 
care test (such as a urine dip). For maximum flexibility, this room is designed exactly 
like the General Exam/Treatment room, except it is equipped with a reclining type of 
exam chair rather than a stretcher. Depending on surge demands within the ED, or

6. PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. GENERAL 
1. Refer to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Construction Facilities 
Management (CFM) Handbooks, Standards, Standard Details, and Design Guides for 
technical criteria available at the VA Technical Information Library (TIL). 
2. Refer to Emergency Department PG-18-12 Design Guide Section 2: Narrative; SubSection
2.2: Emergency Department Operations & 2.5: Planning Emergency 
Department Facilities. 
3. Refer to Section 8: Functional Diagrams in this document for illustration of the 
following Planning and Design Considerations. 
4. Provide proper visual control of patient areas by ED staff, including circulation 
spaces, to assist in the monitoring and caring for the elderly patient. 
5. Provide 100 percent accessibility to all patient areas and circulation spaces indoors 
as well as at access points to facility. 
B. RECEPTION / PUBLIC AREA 
1. The Security Station shall be positioned to allow “back door” exit to access a corridor 
to the main ED without traveling through the General Waiting area. There shall be a 
clear and direct path from the entry/metal detectors to the First Look reception area 
(without walking through General Waiting). 
2. Public areas are developed for safe and secure environment for Veterans, staff, 
families, and visitors that arrive at the ED with patients.  The emphasis is on 
developing a safe and secure environment for the public.  Patients are to be 
expedited to triage or a care area and moved ahead in the process. it is the intent 
that limited patients be placed back in the public area and, instead, move forward to 
care areas or internal waiting areas as part of expediting their access to the 
provider/physician. 
3. The General Waiting shall have direct access to outside windows for daylight. It must 
be visually observable from the Reception desk and First Look Station. Provision shall 
be provided for public toilets, drinking water, and public communication services. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
256 – Emergency Department (ED) 
42 of 49 
C. RECEPTION / PUBLIC / PATIENT AREA 
1. The rooms/spaces of the ED are organized in ten different functional areas. These 
areas begin to define the natural organization of the department. Then depending 
on the size of the ED, will change the layout and modularity of the department. The 
Reception/Public Area, Security/Police Area, and Patient Assessment Area all work 
together as the public facing part of the ED. 
2. The Patient Assessment Area is the portal to the rest of the ED and connects the 
patient to the clinical and staff areas. The clinical areas shall be designed in a 
modular approach with the basic planning module being twelve (12) E/T Rooms 
physically organized in groups of four (4) E/T rooms to maximize the staffing ratio of 
1 nurse to 4 patients. 
3. Decontamination showers shall be designed with multiple showerheads and/or 
heads on flexible hoses to adequately wash all parts of the patient’s body. The 
shower room must accommodate a patient on a stretcher also.  The patient then is 
moved into a Decontamination Patient Changing Room to dry off and put on a 
hospital-provided gown before being moved to an E/T Room. 
4. Placement of the large Bariatric Patient E/T Room(s) shall be considered near the 
Resuscitation Room allowing it to be utilized as overflow resuscitation. If considered, 
a Simulation/Resuscitation Viewing Room, for staff training, shall be located 
adjacent to one side of the Resuscitation Room, for direct visual observation and 
training. 
5. A Results Pending Waiting Room needs to be in a highly visible area where clinical 
personnel can maintain visual control of those utilizing the space.  Patients may wait 
here for final discharge instructions.  This space shall be near a consultation room so 
results and discharge instructions can be delivered in a confidential environment. 
6. A Triage Room is where a nurse will assess patients' severity of injury or illness 
within a short time after their arrival, assign priorities, and transfer each patient to 
the appropriate place in the ED for treatment. The Triage Room shall be designed 
with direct access and visual observation of the ED Waiting Room. If possible, the 
Security Station shall have visibility through the glass-front triage room to observe 
first interaction between nurse and patient. 
7. The Triage Room is also designed to have flow-through patient movement, so they 
enter directly from the Waiting Room and exit directly into the clinical area of the 
ED. Generally, the patient will be seated in a reclining type of exam chair. 
8. The General E/T Room is used for patient consultation, examination, and various 
noninvasive treatments and procedures. There is an expectation of physical contact, 
or “laying on of hands,” between the caregiver and patient. This room is the basic 
building block of the clinical treatment rooms within the ED. 
9. A negative-pressure Airborne Infection Isolation (AII) E/T Room is designed to isolate 
a patient who is suspected of, or has been diagnosed with, an airborne infectious 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
256 – Emergency Department (ED) 
43 of 49 
disease. This room is required to have an anteroom where all entry/exit of patients, 
staff, and equipment into the AII room must pass through. Also, this room has a 
dedicated toilet that can only be accessed from within the AII room. 
10. A positive-pressure Protective Environment (PE) E/T Room is designed to protect the 
immunosuppressed patient. This room shall be located distally from any Airborne 
Infection Isolation E/T Room. 
11. The Mental Health Intervention Room shall be located away from the waiting area 
and have a Nurse Workstation adjacent. While it is not a seclusion/restraint room, it 
shall meet the standards of the Mental Health Intervention Room for construction, 
equipment, and furnishings, outlined in the current Mental Health Environment of 
Care Checklist. 
12. The Mental Health E/T Room is a diversely designed swing room that can be utilized 
as a General E/T Room or one dedicated to patients who are triaged with a mental 
health condition. This E/T room is shown to be both right- and left-handed layout. 
This is done to provide a central nurse observation desk, for two people, with direct 
observation into two adjacent Mental Health E/T Rooms. 
13. Most EDs are being designed with internal imaging services. It is still important to 
have an understanding between the ED and imaging about the use, or back-up use, 
of potentially shared diagnostic rooms. 
14. The Emergency Imaging Area may be part of the main VAMC Imaging Services if it is 
immediately adjacent to the Emergency Department and in a smaller ED. In a 
medium to large ED, Imaging Areas will be dedicated to the Emergency Department. 
Gowned Imaging Patient Waiting shall be on the edge of the imaging area closest to 
the initial assessment area and fast-track care area. The patient dressing area shall 
be adjacent to the Gowned Imaging Patient Waiting area and have access to the ED 
Imaging Toilet Room. 
D. AMBULANCE / EMS AREA 
1. Ambulance / EMS entry shall have a covered canopy or enclosed garage depending 
on local facility requirements and geographic location. Drop-off canopies may be 
designed in either drive-thru or back-in unloading configurations; garages shall be 
designed in drive-thru configurations. 
2. The Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Outbound / Inbound Staging / Holding Room 
is an open bay configured to temporarily hold a patient either arriving at or 
departing the ED. This staging area may be combined with outbound patient holding 
room / bay for patients waiting to be transferred to another area within the VAMC. 
For incoming patients arriving by ambulance, that may need to be held here before 
being moved into the Resuscitation Room or an E/T Room. 
E. STAFF WORK AREA 
1. Staff/providers need to be in a position to visually monitor and control the clinical 
areas in the best interest of clinical safety and overall security. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
256 – Emergency Department (ED) 
44 of 49 
2. Open work/charting area shall be available with visual control of triage rooms and 
access paths back into ED.  In smaller EDs the work/charting area may be the central 
ED staff workstation. 
3. Consideration shall be given to how a main ED staff work area can be positioned to 
allow for visual control of the EMS Vestibule.  EMS entry point shall have direct 
access to wheelchair and stretcher storage, EMS Staff Workstation, EMS Supply 
Room, and EMS Staff Toilet. EMS Staff Workstation shall be positioned to maintain a 
view of ambulances. EMS crews may have exterior access to EMS Drop-off Storage 
Room. 
4. Provide an open staff work core for each ED module (about 12 E/T rooms) providing 
workspace and non-public staff circulation while visually connecting exam and 
treatment rooms. This space provides for team huddles and planning, required staff 
computer access, patient arrival, and scheduling notifications, etc. 
5. A Provider Workroom is typically a glass-enclosed room and needs to be located 
near the central nurse work area. The design may include one of these workrooms 
per 12 E/T room module, or they could be combined at an intersection between two 
modules. 
6. A Medication Room or Alcove will typically be a room which shall be under the visual 
control of the nursing staff. Where one or more automated supply dispensing units 
are present, the room needs to be designed with space to prepare medications. 
7. Staff work areas in a care module shall not be isolated from other care areas and 
shall have visibility to adjacent staff work areas in other care modules.  Isolation 
rooms and internal ED waiting areas shall be located on the side of the care module 
closest to the upfront assessment area or just off the main circulation corridor to 
allow for immediate access within a care module. 
F. LAYOUT 
1. Provide a direct access from First Look Station and Triage Room(s) to EMS 
Decontamination facilities. 
2. Triage rooms shall “flow through” with accessibility from General Waiting with 
separate “back door” for flow to main ED Patient Care areas. 
3. First Look shall have an escape path back into the ED in the event of dangerous 
situation. Direct access to PPE, patient toilet/shower and support spaces.  In smaller 
EDs these components may be shared with main ED care area(s). 
4. Fast-Track shall be an area that can flex with the main emergency department care 
area. Fast-Track shall be considered in an area close to the assessment area allowing 
rapid turnaround for non-urgent patients. An internal ED patient accessible waiting 
area shall be near fast track to allow non-urgent patients to await testing results. 
This space shall be visible to staff work areas to maintain visual control of 
patients/families 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
256 – Emergency Department (ED) 
45 of 49 
5. Locate Eye/ENT and Orthopedic Treatment Room(s) as well as the GYN and the 
Airborne Infection Isolation (AII) E/T Room(s) Orthopedic Treatment Rooms near the 
Fast Track E/T Room(s). 
6. Orthopedic Treatment Room, in the main ED, shall be near the imaging area. 
7. If the number of the Mental Health E/T Rooms is large, consider creating a dedicated 
mental health care zone, which shall remain adjacent with the main ED Patient Area. 
This separate-but-adjacent care area would allow staff to flex in and out of the 
mental health area in support of patient care. 
8. Direct access from the Reception / Public Area to the Mental Health (MH) Sally Port 
is a priority. The MH Sally port shall have direct access to a MH Private Search Room. 
Patient Belongings Storage shall be near or adjacent to the Sally port and MH Private 
Search Room. Toilet/shower shall be in the proximity of ED Mental Health 
Intervention Room or within a secured ED mental health unit. 
9. A key priority is to maintain a visual connection from the MH work area to adjacent 
ED staff work areas (nurse stations) in an adjacent care area. The intent is that no 
staff are isolated in the MH area without visual connection to other team members. 
There shall be no “dead-end” corridors. Escape paths for staff need to be considered 
if the area will be “locked-down”. Consider escape paths from the main workarea to 
outside the unit. Support areas (clean, soiled, etc.) shall be secured access and must 
include escape paths out the backside of support spaces, so no staff is trapped in the 
support areas. 
10. The Resuscitation Room(s) shall have direct accessibility from the EMS/ambulance 
Entry. Central staff work areas shall have direct visual control of the Resuscitation 
Room(s). 
11. Resuscitation Storage Room shall be adjacent to the Resuscitation Room. 
Consideration shall be given to access this storage room from inside the 
Resuscitation Room and from the main corridor allowing staff to access this storage 
room even while resuscitation is taking place. 
12. Design shall accommodate patient privacy and confidentiality in all areas, and in 
reception and patient care areas. This includes visual and auditory considerations. 
13. Corridors shall be designed to a minimum of 8 feet clear width to accommodate 
passage of equipment or beds and two stretchers and/or wheelchairs. 
14. The main circulation corridor concept provides a circulation path that allows 
patients to come from the assessment area and circulate to any care module 
without traversing through other care modules. The main corridor also allows 
patients to come from any care module, access imaging, and return to their care 
module without traversing through other care modules.

1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines space planning parameters and metrics for Urgent Care projects 
based on projected workload. It applies to all Urgent Care clinical services in all medical 
facilities at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Pertinent sections of this document are 
implemented in the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) software; planners 
working on VA Urgent Care projects can create standardized baseline space plans. 
The following VHA policy document(s), data source(s) and Industry Standards have been 
reviewed, referenced, and incorporated as appropriate: 
VHA Directive 1101.13 VHA Urgent Care, Mar 20, 2023 
VHA Emergency Medicine Management Tool (EMMT) System-wide Report FY15-19 
2. DEFINITIONS 
Airborne Transmission: infection spread through exposure to those virus-containing 
respiratory droplets comprised of smaller droplets and particles that can remain suspended 
in the air over long distances (usually greater than 6 feet) and time (typically hours). 
Direct Line of Sight: A direct, unobstructed, line of sight from a clinician to a patient, which 
is essential for suicide prevention. 
Emergency Department Integration Software (EDIS): The patient “tracking” system that is 
used in VA emergency departments across the country. This interfaces with the CPRS or 
CERNER electronic health record system. 
Emergency Escalation of Care: Emergency escalation of care is a situation in which a patient 
presents to an Urgent Care with a condition, or develops a condition while in Urgent Care, 
that is beyond the capabilities of the Urgent Care to safely evaluate or treat and who 
requires 911 emergent transfer to a higher level of care. 
Emergency Medical Services (EMS): EMS is a type of Emergency Service dedicated to 
providing out-of-hospital Acute medical care and/or transport to definitive care, to patients 
with illnesses and injuries which the patient, or the medical practitioner, believes 
constitutes a medical emergency. 
Exam / Treatment Room (E/T Rm): An UC patient room used for a variety of functions 
including patient examination and various treatments or procedures; this room is sized and 
equipped based on the specific clinical function it is intended to support. The following E/T 
Rms are included in this document: General, Fast-Track, Airborne Infection Isolation, Mental 
Health, Bariatric, and GYN.  
First Look: A term utilized to identify a clinical staff member who initially observes the 
patient entering the facility through the walk-in entrance, usually as part of the 
triage/assessment and sorting function upon patient arrival. 
Triage: The process of determining the priority of patients’ treatments by the severity of 
their condition or likelihood of recovery with and without treatment. 
Urgent Care Level: Refer to VHA Directive 1101.13  
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  Published December 1, 2023 
257 – Urgent Care Content Approved October 1, 2023 
Page 3 of 33 
VA Medical Center (VAMC): A VA hospital facility that provides a diverse range of health 
care services to Veterans. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Accessible: A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with provisions outlined 
in the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA). 
Architectural Barriers Act (ABA): A set of standards developed to ensure that all buildings 
financed with federal funds are designed and constructed to be fully accessible to everyone. 
This law requires all construction, renovation, or leasing of sites, facilities, buildings, and 
other elements, financed with federal funds, to comply with the Architectural Barriers Act 
Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). The ABAAS replaces the Uniform Federal Accessibility 
Standards (UFAS). 
Average Length of Encounter (ALoE): Averaged length of time, in minutes, a patient spends 
in an Exam / Treatment Room interacting with a provider and the clinical support team. It is 
accounted from room “set-up” to “clean-up” by staff. This metric is used to determine the 
number of annual patient / provider encounters that take place in an Exam / Treatment 
Room which, in turn, is used to calculate the number of Exam / Treatment Rooms needed in 
a facility based on projected annual workload. The ALoE is determined with VHA SME input 
during a PG-18-9 clinical chapter revision / update. 
Average Length of Stay (ALoS): The average number of days a patient Veteran stays in an 
inpatient care unit. The ALoS is used to calculate the number of patient bedrooms for a 
specialty by dividing the site’s projected workload by the ALoS. 
Baseline Space Program: A list of rooms / spaces organized by Functional Area generated by 
SEPS based on mission, workload, or staffing inputs. This is the starting point for a project, 
this space program can be modified by planner based on local user input. 
Clinic Stop: Per these criteria, a clinic stop is the workload unit of measure for space 
planning. Clinic Stops are codified by VSSC, when applicable, they are referenced by number 
in the calculation of workload driven patient care spaces in this document. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter determined by VA for each PG-18-9 
clinical and non-clinical department space planning criteria chapter. It is used to calculate 
the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) area based on the programmed Net Square Feet 
(NSF). 
Encounter: An interaction between a patient Veteran and a VA provider or providers in an 
Exam Room / Treatment Room / Consultation Room / Procedure Room, spaces where a 
patient Veteran received clinical care. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE)
: A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  Published December 1, 2023 
257 – Urgent Care Content Approved October 1, 2023 
Page 4 of 33 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS)
: A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Patient Unique: (or Unique Patient), A Veteran patient counted as a unique in each division 
from which they receive care. Patient Uniques are included in the Registry for a VA Medical 
Center. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of December 2022 there are 53 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter.

Project Gross (PG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross Square 
Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Project Gross Square Footage. This factor 
accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, horizontal 
and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, shafts, and 
mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 1.35 and 
established guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) in 
SEPS. PG Factor is also referred as Building Gross Factor. 
Provider: A medical professional who examines, diagnoses, treats, prescribes medication, 
and manages the care of patients within his or her scope of practice as established by the 
governing body of a healthcare organization. 
Room Code (RM CD): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-189
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space 
Table for VA projects. 
Room Count (RM Count): The number of rooms generated in a baseline Program for Design 
based on workload. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
Room Efficiency Factor: A factor that provides flexibility in the utilization of a room to 
account for patient delays, scheduling conflicts, and equipment maintenance. Common 
factors are in the 75% to 85% range. A room with 80% room efficiency provides a buffer to 
assume that this room would be available 20% of the time beyond the planned operational 
practices for this room. This factor may be adjusted based on the actual and/or anticipated 
operations and processes of the room/department at a particular facility. 
Room Net Square Feet (RM NSF): The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical 
function to take place in a room / space, it includes the floor area required by medical 
equipment and supporting furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated 
clearances. Room area is presented in Net Square Meters (NSM) as well. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section.

Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
Stop Code: A measure of workload including clinic stops forecasted by the Office of Policy 
and Planning (OPP) for all Strategic Planning Categories at Medical Center and Outpatient 
Clinic levels. 
Telehealth: The use of technology, such as computers and mobile devices, to manage 
healthcare remotely. It includes a variety of health care services, including but not limited to 
online support groups, online health information and self-management tools, email and 
online communication with health care providers, remote monitoring of vital signs, video, 
or online doctor visits. Depending on the concept of operations for this space, it may be 
equipped as an exam room or as a consult room with video/camera capability. 
Utilization Rate: A factor used in the calculation of a directly workload-driven room 
throughput. It represents, in a percent value, the room is idle based on the planning 
assumptions. For example, if a directly workload-driven room is available for use 8 hours a 
day, the Utilization Rate represents the assumed time it will be used, an 85% utilization rate 
indicates, for planning purposes, the room will be used 6.8 hours a day. An additional 
directly workload-driven room will be provided in the calculation once the previous room 
has reached 100% utilization. The utilization Rate is embedded in the Room Throughput 
value calculated in Section 3 of this document. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality.

Workstation: Area outfitted with equipment and furnishings, typically allocated 50 NSF for 
clinical work areas or 56 NSF for administrative work areas. Managers and other staff with 
no direct reports as well as part-time, seasonal, and job-sharing staff may qualify for a 
workstation. Such environments are particularly conducive to team-oriented office 
groupings. These environments work best when they have access to conference and small 
group meeting spaces. 
3. OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the UC Space 
Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed with participation of VHA Urgent Care / 
Emergency Medicine SMEs, VA CFM personnel and Specialized Consultant. The UC 
SPCM lists all the rooms / spaces a VA UC site would require, regardless of location, 
organized by Functional Area. Total Room (RM) Count and NSF for a Project is generated 
based on projected workload for up to 25 Exam / Treatment (E/T) Rooms, all types, 
based on allocation in the SPCM ranges. This document is uploaded to SEPS and the 
corresponding 25 testing SEPS Scenarios produced and verified against the SPCM. 
B. RM Count and Room net square footage (RM NSF) for every space / room for each of 
the 25 E/T Rm ranges is calculated in the UC Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) for 
every workload range. Resulting values are reflected in the Room Criteria Statements for 
each Room in Section 5 of this document. Each range represents an UC E/T Rm annual 
throughput increment of 765 Stop Code 131 encounters. Space Planning parameters 
herein developed cover a projected workload of between 191 and 19,125 annual UC 
encounters. 
C. VSSC’s EDIS UC National Report FY17-21 (except FY20) Report for 26 UCs Levels I, II & III 
sites were used to develop the ranges covering the workload demand of the existing VA 
UC sites as well as for potential future larger facilities. 
D. Annual UC E/T Room (all types) Throughput was determined based on the following 
parameters: 
1. Target VA Urgent Care Average Length of Encounter (ALoE) = 125 mins. 
2. Number of operating days / year: 249 
3. Resulting annual E/T Room throughput (at 100%): 956 encounters 
4. Adopted annual E/T Room throughput (at 80% Utilization Rate): 765 encounters 
E. Space planners working on VA UC projects can generate a Baseline Program for Design 
(PFD) by entering the projected Stop Code 131 workload for the target year for the VA 
Station they are working on for UCs Levels I, II or III. The SEPS generated PFD is the 
baseline space program to begin the project planning process. The space calculation 
parameters (RM Count and RM NSF) is driven by projected workload regardless of UC 
Level I, II or III designation. Selection of Level determines provision / omission of certain 
rooms in the PFD.

F. The Department Net to Gross (DNTG) factor for UCs is 1.50, the Project Gross (PG) 
factor for all departments is set in SEPS. These factors are used in the baseline space 
calculation as follows: 
1. Answers to Input Data Statements are processed by the Room Criteria Statements in 
each room and determine the RM Count and RM NSF corresponding to the 
projected workload. The total RM Count and RM NSF generated organized by 
Functional Area (FA) becomes the Baseline Project. 
2. The Department Net to Gross (DNTG) factor is multiplied by the total baseline NSF to 
generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF). 
3. The Project Gross (PG) factor is multiplied by the aggregate Department Gross 
Square Feet (DGSF) to generate the total Project Gross Square Feet (PGSF). 
4. The DNTG factor is set for every Department in the corresponding PG-18-9 chapter. 
The PGSF is set at 1.35 and is editable for a project, planners shall adjust the 
resulting Project Net to Gross ratio by adjusting the PGSF factor in the Project Level 
Program for Design (PFD) tab in SEPS following the “Guidelines” link in this screen. 
G. SEPS also generates the Project Room Contents (PRC) for each room in the project. The 
PRC includes the equipment, furniture and fixtures assigned to each room per the 
VA257 UC PG-18-5: Equipment Guidelist. 
H. The VA 257 UC PG-18-12: Design Guide contains a Narrative, detailed functional 
diagrams, and detailed room templates for XX unique UC rooms. 
I. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-5, PG-18-9 and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website. 
J. Assignment of the resulting workload generated UC E/T Rms for a project is done by 
range based on Table 1 below. 
Cols (1) and (2): Workload values for each range. 
Col (3): Number of workload driven UC E/T Rms generated. 
Col (4): UC E/T Rm types 
Col (5): Number of General (GEN) E/T Rooms by Range 
Col (6): Number of Mental Health (MH) E/T Rooms by Range 
Col (7): Number of Airborne Infection Isolation (AII) E/T Rooms by Range 
Col (8): Number of Gynecology (GYN) E/T Rooms by Range 
Col (9): Number of Bariatric (BAR) E/T Rooms by Range 
Numeric values in this table are assigned to each room / range in the SPCM and 
reflected in Room Criteria Statement (RCS) for each of these rooms in Section 5 below.

1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines space planning criteria for VA Program Guide (PG) 18-9 Chapter 
258: Women Veterans Clinical Service (WVCS). It applies to all medical facilities of the 
Veterans Health Administration (VHA) at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
VHA Handbooks 1330.01, Healthcare Services for Women Veterans (dated May 21, 2010) 
and 1330.02 Women Veterans Program Manager (WVPM) Position (dated March 28, 2007) 
have been reviewed as part of the development of this Space Planning Criteria Chapter and 
the space criteria contained herein responds to the information and requirements of these 
Handbooks where appropriate. These handbooks should be referred to prior to any space 
programming effort for additional information. The Women Veterans Clinical Service 
(WVCS) program supports the Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT) delivery model for Primary 
Care. 
The Women Veterans Health Strategic Health Care Group (WVHSHG) has adopted the 
following principles to provide the highest quality care for our women Veterans: 
A. Comprehensive primary care 
B. Provided by proficient and interested primary care clinicians 
C. Focused on safety, dignity, and sensitivity to gender-specific needs 
D. Offering the right care in the right place at the right time 
E. Using state-of-the-art health care equipment and technology 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Ambulatory Care: Primary Care Clinic (AC: PCC): An Ambulatory Care: Primary Care Clinic 
space within a VA Medical Center / Hospital. 
Comprehensive Primary Care for Women Veterans: The provision of complete primary care 
and care coordination by one primary care provider at one site. The primary care provider 
should, in the context of a longitudinal relationship, fulfill all primary care needs such as 
Care for Acute and Chronic Illness, Gender-Specific Primary Care, Preventive Services, 
Mental Health Services, and Coordination of Care. (Refer to VHA Handbook 1330.01 for a 
complete review of comprehensive Primary Care for Women Veterans services). 
Comprehensive Primary Care Clinic Models: Comprehensive Primary Care for women 
veterans is, per VHA Handbook 1330.01 is offered in three service- directed models of care: 
A. Model 1: General Primary Care Clinic 
Comprehensive primary care services for women Veterans is delivered by a designated 
Women’s Health Primary Care Provider (WH PCP) who is interested and proficient in 
women’s health. Women Veterans are incorporated into the WH PCP panel and seen 
within a general gender-neutral Primary Care clinic. Mental health services for women 
should be co-located in the general gender-neutral Primary Care Clinic in accordance 
with the Primary Care-Mental Health Integration. Efficient referral to specialty 
gynecology service must be available either on-site or through fee-basis, contractual or 
sharing agreements, or referral to other VA facilities within a reasonable traveling 
distance (less than 50 miles). 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
258 – Women Veterans Clinical Service (WVCS) (For Models 2 and 3) 
3 of 24 
B. Model 2: Separate but Shared Space 
Comprehensive primary care services for women Veterans are offered by designated 
Women’s Health Primary Care Providers (WH PCPs) in a separate but shared space that 
may be located within or adjacent to Primary Care clinic areas. Gynecological care and 
mental health services should be co-located in this space and readily available. 
C. Model 3: Womens Health Center (WHC) 
VHA facilities with larger women Veterans populations are encouraged to create 
Womens Health Centers (WHC) that provide the highest level of coordinated, high 
quality comprehensive care to women Veterans. 
Military Sexual Trauma (MST) (defined according to Title 38 U.S. Code 1720D): “physical 
assault of a sexual nature, battery of a sexual nature or sexual harassment that occurred 
while a Veteran was serving on active duty or active duty for training.” Sexual harassment is 
further defined as “repeated, unsolicited verbal or physical contact of a sexual nature which 
is threatening in character.” The location where the sexual trauma occurred, the genders of 
the people involved, and their relationship to each other do not matter. 
Outpatient Clinic: An Outpatient Clinic is a freestanding ambulatory care facility that is 
physically separated but administratively attached to a VA Medical Center providing a 
specific set of outpatient services. 
Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT): Patient Aligned Care Team, providing service to Veterans 
that is patient-centered, is the right care at the right time by the right person. A typical 
PACT Team is comprised of a Provider, RN, LPN/Health Tech and a Clerk. 
Provider (Primary / Specialty Care): A medical professional, such as a physician, nurse 
practitioner, or physician assistant, providing care to Veteran patients. 
Teamlet: The core PACT team of the Veteran patient, his / her provider, a RN care manager, 
a clinical staff assistant, and an administrative staff member that are responsible for the 
central functions of a medical home model. Each Teamlet can accommodate a Panel. 
Teamlets can be combined in PACT modules for collaborative care. Panel sizes vary based 
on the patient demographic at each VA facility; the Office for Primary Care utilizes an 
average panel size of 1,200 patients for planning purposes. 
VISN: Acronym for Veteran Integrated Service Network. 
Women’s Health Primary Care Provider (WH PCP): A primary care provider who is dedicated 
to and proficient in women’s health. A designated WH PCP is preferentially assigned women 
Veterans within their primary care patient panels. 
Women Veterans Program Manager (WVPM): (Refer to VHA Handbook 1330.02 for a 
complete review of the role of the Women Veterans Program Manager). The WVPM is 
responsible for executing comprehensive planning for women’s health issues that improves 
the overall quality of care provided to women Veterans and achieves program goals and 
outcomes.

258 – Women Veterans Clinical Service (WVCS) (For Models 2 and 3) 
4 of 24 
Women Veterans Clinical Service patient Panel: Each Panel is assigned 800 Unique Patients. 
For the purpose of this Chapter, it is assumed that each unique patient will generate 3.5 
annual visits; hence a Panel will handle 2,800 annual visits. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Accessible: A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with provisions outlined 
in the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA). 
Architectural Barriers Act (ABA): A set of standards developed to ensure that all buildings 
financed with federal funds are designed and constructed to be fully accessible to everyone. 
This law requires all construction, renovation, or leasing of sites, facilities, buildings, and 
other elements, financed with federal funds, to comply with the Architectural Barriers Act 
Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). The ABAAS replaces the Uniform Federal Accessibility 
Standards (UFAS). 
Average Length of Encounter (ALoE): Averaged length of time, in minutes, a patient spends 
in an Exam / Treatment Room interacting with a provider and the clinical support team. It is 
accounted from room “set-up” to “clean-up” by staff. This metric is used to determine the 
number of annual patient / provider encounters that take place in an Exam / Treatment 
Room which, in turn, is used to calculate the number of Exam / Treatment Rooms needed in 
a facility based on projected annual workload. The ALoE is determined with VHA SME input 
during a PG-18-9 clinical chapter revision / update. 
Average Length of Stay (ALoS): The average number of days a patient Veteran stays in an 
inpatient care unit. The ALoS is used to calculate the number of patient bedrooms for a 
specialty by dividing the site’s projected workload by the ALoS. 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Clinic Stop: Per these criteria, a clinic stop is the workload unit of measure for space 
planning. Clinic Stops are codified by VSSC, when applicable, they are referenced by number 
in the calculation of workload driven patient care spaces in this document. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Encounter: An interaction between a patient Veteran and a VA provider or providers in an 
Exam Room / Treatment Room / Consultation Room / Procedure Room, spaces where a 
patient Veteran received clinical care.

5 of 24 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Patient Unique: (or Unique Patient), A Veteran patient counted as a unique in each division 
from which they receive care. Patient Uniques are included in the Registry for a VA Medical 
Center. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs.

PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements, and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Provider: An individual who examines, diagnoses, treats, prescribes medication, and 
manages the care of patients within his or her scope of practice as established by the 
governing body of a healthcare organization. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
Room Efficiency Factor: A factor that provides flexibility in the utilization of a room to 
account for patient delays, scheduling conflicts, and equipment maintenance. Common 
factors are in the 75% to 85% range. A room with 80% room efficiency provides a buffer to 
assume that this room would be available 20% of the time beyond the planned operational 
practices for this room. This factor may be adjusted based on the actual and/or anticipated 
operations and processes of the room/department at a particular facility. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
258 – Women Veterans Clinical Service (WVCS) (For Models 2 and 3) 
7 of 24 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
Stop Code: A measure of workload including clinic stops forecasted by the Office of Policy 
and Planning (OPP) for all Strategic Planning Categories at Medical Center and Outpatient 
Clinic levels. 
Telehealth: The use of technology, such as computers and mobile devices, to manage 
healthcare remotely. It includes a variety of health care services, including but not limited to 
online support groups, online health information and self-management tools, email and 
online communication with health care providers, remote monitoring of vital signs, video, 
or online doctor visits. Depending on the concept of operations for this space, it may be 
equipped as an exam room or as a consult room with video/camera capability. 
Utilization Rate: A factor used in the calculation of a directly workload-driven room 
throughput. It represents, in a percent value, the room is idle based on the planning 
assumptions. For example, if a directly workload-driven room is available for use 8 hours a 
day, the Utilization Rate represents the assumed time it will be used, an 85% utilization rate 
indicates, for planning purposes, the room will be used 6.8 hours a day. An additional 
directly workload-driven room will be provided in the calculation once the previous room 
has reached 100% utilization. The utilization Rate is embedded in the Room Throughput 
value calculated in Section 3 of this document. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
Workstation: Area outfitted with equipment and furnishings, typically allocated 56 NSF 
each. Managers and other staff with no direct reports as well as part-time, seasonal, and 
job-sharing staff may qualify for a workstation. Such environments are particularly 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
258 – Women Veterans Clinical Service (WVCS) (For Models 2 and 3) 
8 of 24 
conducive to team-oriented office groupings. These environments work best when they 
have access to conference and small group meeting spaces. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space planning criteria included in this Standard have been specifically developed for 
this Department / Service in a Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare facility based 
on established VHA policy and guidelines to define the scope of services provided for 
the existing workload demand as well as that in the foreseeable future. Rooms and 
Functional Areas are provided based on research of clinical and non-clinical activities 
performed in this Department. 
B. Development / update of VA’s Program Guide (PG) standards is a research based effort 
executed with participation of VHA Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), VA-Construction and 
Facilities Management Office (CFM) professional staff and specialty consultants hired for 
the task. These space planning standards are based on current applicable VHA policies 
and guidelines, established and/or anticipated best practice standards, and latest 
medical technology developments. Workload metrics were tailored to satisfy current 
and anticipated veteran workload demand. 
C. The space planning component of PG-18-9 is based on the Space Planning Concept 
Matrix (SPCM) which lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and assigns room 
quantity (Q) and area (NSF) for a series of ranges corresponding to the smallest to the 
largest department for this service in the VA healthcare system in incremental size; each 
range corresponds to a workload parameter which determines the number and area of 
each directly workload-driven room. The remainder of the rooms in the range i.e., 
waiting, storage, staff workstations, etc. are determined by ratios to the resulting 
number of or NSF of the workload-driven rooms. 
D. Sections 4 and 5 of these space planning standards as well as the PG-18-5 standard are 
implemented in the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) and hosted at the 
MAX.gov website so planners working on VA Construction projects can develop single or 
multi-department projects based on these PG-18-9- and the PG-18-5 standards. Output 
from SEPS is through Space and Contents Reports; the Space Report is the Program for 
Design (PFD), the Content Report is the Project Room Contents (PRC). Inclusion of a 
Functional Area as well as Room quantity (Q) and determination of the room area (NSF) 
in the PFD is based on the projected Workload input which triggers calculations included 
in the Room Criteria Statements (RCSs). The RCSs are placed immediately after each 
room name, room code and baseline area (NSF). The PRC list the medical equipment, 
furniture and fixtures associated to each Room Code in the project. The PFD & PRC are 
the baseline requirements for the planning phase of a VA project based on a site’s 
projected workload for the target planning year. This chapter’s corresponding PG-18-12, 
Design Guide -if available- is intended for use during the design phase of the project. 
E. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Women 
Veteran Service Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as the basis for this 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
258 – Women Veterans Clinical Service (WVCS) (For Models 2 and 3) 
9 of 24 
chapter. The Women Veteran Service SPCM lists all the spaces a VA Women Veteran 
Service site would require; the quantity and NSF for each room is calculated based on 
the Women Veteran Service projected workload. The SPCM is organized in 18 ranges 
each for Model 2 and Model 3, each range represents an incremental workload value 
equivalent to one Patient Care Room, this way all current VA Women Veteran Service 
sites are covered in the SPCM. The upper ranges are calculated for future facilities in 
case a higher projected workload or FTE positions authorized than those at the present 
time for Women Veteran Service. The 18 ranges in the SPCM for either Model 2 or 
Model 3 are organized in three groups of 6 each as follows: 
1. Ranges 1 to 6: Women’s Clinic, Stop Code 322, between 422 and 8,448 annual clinic 
stops (in increments of 1,408) 
2. Ranges 7 to 12: Gynecology, Stop Code 404, between 370 and 7,392 annual clinic 
stops (in increments of 1,232) 
3. Ranges 13 to 18: Female Gender Specific Cancer Screening, Stop Code 704, between 
370 and 7,392 annual clinic stops (in increments of 1,232) 
F. The SPCM metrics are translated into one (or more) Room Criteria Statement (RCS) for 
each room in Section 5 of this document. The SPCM Planning Range, the maximum 
number of directly workload-driven patient care rooms, in this document is 10. If a 
project shall require provision of workload driven rooms above the maximum range 
value refer to CFM for guidance. Rooms in this space planning document are organized 
in 5 Functional Areas (FAs). 
G. Based on its intended function, each room / space is assigned a: 
1. Room Name (RN), 
2. Room Code (RC), 
3. Room Area, the Net Square Feet (NSF) and its corresponding “soft metric” Net 
Square Meters (NSM), 
4. Unique Room Criteria Statement(s) (RCSs) correlated to answers to Input Data 
Statements (IDSs), and 
5. Room Comment as needed. 
H. The Room Codes included in this chapter stem from the VA Room Family. A unique 
support space, that may have variable area, is assigned a unique Room Code, and 
adopts the square footage, as needed, correlated to the room contents assigned which 
in turn correspond to the range for those rooms. A unique clinical space or a direct 
clinical support room, i.e., control room, system components room, etc. typically does 
not feature variable NSF. Patient Care room names for rooms unique to this chapter end 
in “, Wm Vet Svc”. Patient Care Support room names end in “, Bldg Sprt”, “Clncl Sprt”, 
“Stff Sprt”, or “, Vet Sprt”, correlating to Building, Clinical, Staff or Veteran Support room 
families. 
I. Section 5, Sub-Section F lists the SEPS Importer Shortcuts used for implementation of 
Sections 4 & 5 in SEPS. These shortcuts are inserted into the Room Criteria Statement 
(RCS) for each room which upon upload into the Space and Equipment Planning System 
(SEPS) allowing planners developing VA healthcare projects to determine quantity and 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
258 – Women Veterans Clinical Service (WVCS) (For Models 2 and 3) 
10 of 24 
square footage of each room by performing mathematical or logical calculations. 
Shortcuts refer Input Data Statements (IDSs), Rooms or calculation parameters 
stemming from the SPCM. 
J. SEPS is accessible to government healthcare planners and private sector consultants 
working on VA HC projects during their Period of Performance (PoP) through the 
MAX.gov website; government provided Training is a requisite for access. 
K. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross factor (NTDG) factor of 1.50 for Women 
Veteran Service and a Building Gross factor of 1.35 in the space calculation to generate 
the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross Square Feet (BGSF) 
respectively for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet (NSF) for 
each range. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the NTDG factor is fixed. 
L. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-5 Equipment Guidelist for the Room Content 
assignment for each room during the planning phase of a project. 
M. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-12: Design Guide, if available, during the 
planning and design phases of a project. Not all PG-18-9 clinical chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 document, please refer to the VA-TIL. 
N. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website.

2 of 9 
1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines Space Planning Criteria for Chapter 266: Human Resources 
Management. It applies to all medical facilities at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
The activities of Personnel Service relate to recruitment, placement, training, classification 
and pay administration; supervisor-employee relations, and labor management 
administration. 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning system (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
266 – Human Resources Management 
3 of 9 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs.  
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
266 – Human Resources Management

full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Human 
Resources Management Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as a basis for 
this chapter. The SPCM lists all the spaces a VA Human Resources Management facility 
would require; the quantity and NSF for each room is calculated based on the total 
number of FTE positions authorized for the facility organized in five ranges each 
corresponding to 1,000 FTE positions authorized incrementally. 
B. The room quantity (Q) and area (NSF) values included for each range in the SPCM are 
reflected in the Room Criteria Statements, placed immediately below each room name, 
room code and NSF/NSM, for each room in Section 5 of this document. The number of 
Human Resources Management FTE positions authorized is included in the Input Data 
Statements (IDSs) in Section 4. Both Sections are implemented in the Space Planning 
and Equipment System (SEPS) software accessible through the MAX.gov website. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
266 – Human Resources Management 
5 of 9 
Planners programming a VA Human Resources Management project shall develop a 
baseline Program for Design (PFD) in SEPS. 
C. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross (NTDG) factor of 1.30 for Human 
Resources Management and a Building Gross (BG) factor of 1.35 in the space 
calculation. These factors generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the 
Building Gross Square Feet (BGSF) for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net 
Square Feet (NSF) for all Departments included. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in 
SEPS; the NTDG factor is fixed. 
D. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website.

dispensing to patients. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or

that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
PG 18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
268 - Pharmacy Service 
 
   5 of 22 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
PG 18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
268 - Pharmacy Service 
 
   6 of 22 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Pharmacy 
Service Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as a basis for this chapter. The 
SPCM lists all the spaces a VA Pharmacy Service site would require; the quantity and NSF 
for each room is calculated based on the number of outpatient Pharmacy windows, the 
number of patient beds and the number of pharmacy research FTE positions authorized 
organized in seventeen ranges; eight assigned to the outpatient Pharmacy windows, five 
to the patient beds and four to the number of pharmacy research FTE positions 
authorized. 
B. The room quantity (Q) and area (NSF) values included for each range in the SPCM are 
reflected in the Room Criteria Statements, placed immediately below each room name, 
room code and NSF/NSM, for each room in Section 5 of this document. The number of 
Pharmacy Service outpatient windows, facility patient beds and FTE positions are 
included in the Input Data Statements (IDSs) in Section 4. Both Sections are 
implemented in the Space Planning and Equipment System (SEPS) software accessible 
PG 18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
268 - Pharmacy Service 
 
   7 of 22 
through the MAX.gov website. Planners programming a VA Pharmacy Service project 
shall develop a baseline Program for Design (PFD) in SEPS. 
C. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross (NTDG) factor of 1.30 for Pharmacy 
Service and a Building Gross (BG) factor of 1.35 in the space calculation. These factors 
generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross Square Feet 
(BGSF) for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet (NSF) for all 
Departments included. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the NTDG factor is 
fixed. 
D. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website.

6 PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. For additional planning and design criteria, refer to the Department of Veterans Affairs 
(VA) Office of Construction & Facilities Management (CFM) Handbooks, Standards, 
Details, and Design Guides. 
B. While there are several core commonalities between Inpatient and Outpatient 
Pharmacy functions, there are also some fundamental differences regarding adjacency 
requirements, operational organization, and general workflow. As such, Inpatient and 
Outpatient Pharmacy services on a Medical Center campus are typically accommodated 
with one of three general configurations: 
1. IP and OP pharmacies are separate, located in different parts of a building, or in 
different buildings altogether, with no physical connection between the spaces, 
and minimal or no shared support functions. 
2. IP and OP pharmacies are located adjacent to one another, either vertically or 
horizontally. They still function as distinct services, but with the potential for 
sharing of some support functions. 
3. IP and OP pharmacies are co-located within a contiguous building footprint or 
department perimeter. Operationally they still function as distinct services, but 
with increased potential for staff crossover and shared support functions. 
C. Considerations for the location of the Outpatient Pharmacy should include spaces with 
broad visibility, ease of public access, and ability to support ambulatory care services, 
potentially near the main facility entrance or other high-traffic public amenities. 
D. Inpatient Pharmacy does not require public access but should be located to provide 
support for Surgical Suites, Critical Care Units, Emergency Department, and all Nursing 
Units. The need for direct adjacency is reduced by the implementation and distribution 
of automated dispensing machines (ADM), as well as utilization of a pneumatic tube 
distribution system. If a facility does not include a pneumatic tube, physical adjacency 
between the Inpatient Pharmacy, Emergency Department, and Surgical Suites becomes 
more significant. 
PG 18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
268 - Pharmacy Service 
 
   18 of 22 
E. Depending upon the departmental organization or physical space available within a 
facility, the Pharmacy Service Administration offices can be located adjacent to either 
the Inpatient or Outpatient Pharmacy or can be in a separate location. 
F. Refer to VA Directive 0730 Security and Law Enforcement for specific Pharmacy security 
considerations, including general department perimeter construction, dispensing 
window criteria, controlled substance storage, physical and electronic access control, 
and video monitoring requirements. 
G. The Pharmacy Cache portion of the All Hazard Emergency Cache can be stored outside 
of the Pharmacy department perimeter, either incorporated into Logistics warehouse 
space, or another secured storage area with proper security/access control, and which is 
readily accessible if cache activation is required. The listed area of 2,000 NSF is a 
‘placeholder’ value which can be adjusted for each individual project, based on the 
specific needs of the Facility. 
H. Discharge Pharmacist functions are typically handled through the Outpatient Pharmacy, 
then transfer over to Inpatient Pharmacy staff for after-hours or weekend coverage. 
I. Medication dispensing at the Outpatient Pharmacy must be conducted through a secure 
transaction window. This window can also be used for conducting general consults, 
while private consults can take place within the dedicated Consult Room. If the 
Pharmacy prefers to conduct general consults face to face, with no barrier between the 
patient and Pharmacist, separate dedicated consult windows should be established just 
outside of the secure Pharmacy perimeter. 
J. Use of a conveyor system between the Automated Filling Robot and the workstations in 
the Outpatient Filling and Assembly area may not have a significant impact on the 
quantity of space needed, but will greatly influence the configuration of that space, 
including general workflow and circulation patterns throughout the department. See PG 
18-12 Pharmacy Services Design Guide for additional detail. 
K. Medication Consultation Services (Coumadin / anti-coagulation / medication 
management) involve direct patient interaction and are conducted outside of the secure 
Pharmacy perimeter. They can be adjacent to the Outpatient Pharmacy or located closer 
to the ambulatory care clinic if space is available. 
L. As an alternative to standard high-density movable storage shelving, the use of a 
carousel or automated storage and retrieval system can allow for significantly reduced 
square footage requirements, while also providing inventory management and tracking 
capabilities. Equipment costs should be weighed against the savings from reduced 
building area needs. Available space between the floor level of the Pharmacy and the 
underside of the roof/floor structure above can be a limiting factor, as growth in 
carousel capacity is primarily in the vertical direction. Increased structural floor loads 
must also be considered. Typical functions that benefit from carousel utilization are 
Inpatient Filling and Assembly areas, as well as bulk medication storage specifically for 
support of automated filling robots or repackaging processes.

   19 of 22 
M. Facilities that serve a significant Oncology mission may consider establishing a satellite 
location for a dedicated chemotherapy sterile compounding suite. 
N. Departments or services requiring increased or specific medication needs can 
incorporate a Satellite Pharmacy location. The spaces dedicated to those functions are 
typically planned as part of the host department, not as part of Pharmacy Service. Refer 
to the PG 18-9 chapter for that specific service for additional information. 
O. Facilities that may be performing frequent non-sterile hazardous drug compounding 
activities may consider including a dedicated containment hood directly within the 
Hazardous Drug Storage Room. 
P. The default Sterile Compounding Anteroom is sized to accommodate scrubbing/garbing 
activities, as well as access to two Buffer Rooms, a Hazardous Drug Storage Room, and 
the Sterile Compounding Housekeeping Closet. If the number of Buffer Rooms increases 
or decreases, the Anteroom size should be adjusted accordingly. 
Q. Refer to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management Technical Information Library (www.cfm.va.gov/til/) for additional 
technical criteria.

1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines Space Planning Criteria for Chapter 269: Recreation Therapy 
Service. It applies to all medical facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
Recreation Therapy Service Mission Statement: 
“Utilizes a wide range of therapeutic activities to restore the bio-psycho-social functional 
capabilities of Veterans with injuries, chronic illnesses, and other disabling conditions.” 
The Recreation / Creative Arts Therapy program is designed to promote rehabilitation and 
wellness, and to provide disabled Veterans a continuum of care that adds a special value to 
their lives. 
The following PG 18-9 Space Planning Criteria Chapters will need to consider space for 
recreation therapy functions that occur in the areas outside of the main Recreation Therapy 
Service: Mental Health (including Adult Day Health Care, Substance Abuse, MH RRTP), 
Community Living Centers, Acute (M/S, Intensive, Extended Care, and Hospice) Inpatient 
Units, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Service, Spinal Cord Injury and Disorders and 
Blind Rehabilitation, Polytrauma System of Care, Fitness and Wellness Clinic, Ambulatory 
Care – Hospital Based, and Outpatient Clinics. In addition, a Recreation Therapy Service 
functional area should be considered for all clinical areas. 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Aquatic Therapy: Aquatic Therapy is the use of water for resistance instead of utilizing 
manual weights. The goal is to rehabilitate patients after injury or those with chronic illness, 
by avoiding the potentially detrimental impact that manual weights place on joints. Aquatic 
Therapy utilizes a series of exercises and activities designed to take advantage of the unique 
healing benefits of water. The buoyancy provided by water lessens the pressure on muscles 
and joints, assists with movement and reduces swelling caused by gravity. Without the pull 
of gravity working against them, patients can exercise more comfortably, increasing their 
levels of strength, tolerance, flexibility and endurance with less pain and muscle stress. 
Creative Arts Therapy: Creative Arts Therapy is the clinical process of expressing, 
communicating, and exchanging conscious and unconscious thoughts and feelings through 
the arts as interventions to accomplish individualized goals within a therapeutic relationship 
by a credentialed professional who has completed an approved creative arts therapy 
program. Creative Arts Therapy program includes the visual arts dance, music, poetry and 
drama therapy. 
Art Therapy: Art therapy is the therapeutic use of art making, within a professional 
relationship, by people who experience illness, trauma, or challenges in living, and by 
people who seek personal development. 
Dance Therapy: Dance Therapy is the psychotherapeutic use of movement and dance for 
emotional, cognitive, social, behavioral and physical conditions. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
269 – Recreation Therapy Service 
3 of 32 
Drama Therapy: Drama Therapy is the intentional use of theatre techniques to facilitate 
personal growth and promote health, thus treating individuals with a range of mental 
health, cognitive and developmental disorders. 
Music Therapy: Music Therapy is the clinical and evidence-based use of music interventions 
to accomplish individualized goals within a therapeutic relationship by a credentialed 
professional who has completed an approved music therapy program. The therapist uses 
music and all of its facets-physical, emotional, mental, social, aesthetic, and spiritual-to help 
clients to improve or maintain their health. 
Recreation Aid / Rehabilitation Therapy Assistant: Recreation Therapy Assistants carry out a 
variety of assignments that require a practical knowledge of the recreation therapy 
activities or programs to which they are assigned. This practical knowledge, combined with 
skill in the maintenance and use of recreation materials and equipment, is used in providing 
support and assistance to recreation therapists by performing limited aspects of recreation 
therapy work, and by working with patients / residents in well-organized and carefully 
monitored recreation therapy activities. Documents evaluation results and reports data to 
the recreation therapist and members of the treatment team. Reviews and discontinues the 
treatment plan as directed by the recreation therapist. Position Descriptions for each 
Recreation Aid / Assistants will further outline duties as assigned. 
Recreation Therapy: Recreation Therapy, also known as therapeutic recreation, is a 
systematic process that utilizes recreation treatment and other therapeutic interventions 
based upon the assessed; needs of individuals with illnesses and/or disabling conditions. 
The purpose of the recreation therapy process is to improve or maintain physical, cognitive, 
social, emotional and spiritual functioning in order to facilitate full participation in life. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Accessible: A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with provisions outlined 
in the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA). 
Architectural Barriers Act (ABA): A set of standards developed to ensure that all buildings 
financed with federal funds are designed and constructed to be fully accessible to everyone. 
This law requires all construction, renovation, or leasing of sites, facilities, buildings, and 
other elements, financed with federal funds, to comply with the Architectural Barriers Act 
Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). The ABAAS replaces the Uniform Federal Accessibility 
Standards (UFAS). 
Average Length of Encounter (ALoE): Averaged length of time, in minutes, a patient spends 
in an Exam / Treatment Room interacting with a provider and the clinical support team. It is 
accounted from room “set-up” to “clean-up” by staff. This metric is used to determine the 
number of annual patient / provider encounters that take place in an Exam / Treatment 
Room which, in turn, is used to calculate the number of Exam / Treatment Rooms needed in 
a facility based on projected annual workload. The ALoE is determined with VHA SME input 
during a PG-18-9 clinical chapter revision / update. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
269 – Recreation Therapy Service 
4 of 32 
Average Length of Stay (ALoS): The average number of days a patient Veteran stays in an 
inpatient care unit. The ALoS is used to calculate the number of patient bedrooms for a 
specialty by dividing the site’s projected workload by the ALoS. 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Clinic Stop: Per these criteria, a clinic stop is the workload unit of measure for space 
planning. Clinic Stops are codified by VSSC, when applicable, they are referenced by number 
in the calculation of workload driven patient care spaces in this document. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Encounter: An interaction between a patient Veteran and a VA provider or providers in an 
Exam Room / Treatment Room / Consultation Room / Procedure Room, spaces where a 
patient Veteran received clinical care. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
269 – Recreation Therapy Service 
5 of 32 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Patient Unique: (or Unique Patient), A Veteran patient counted as a unique in each division 
from which they receive care. Patient Uniques are included in the Registry for a VA Medical 
Center. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Provider: An individual who examines, diagnoses, treats, prescribes medication, and 
manages the care of patients within his or her scope of practice as established by the 
governing body of a healthcare organization. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
269 – Recreation Therapy Service 
6 of 32 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
Room Efficiency Factor: A factor that provides flexibility in the utilization of a room to 
account for patient delays, scheduling conflicts, and equipment maintenance. Common 
factors are in the 75% to 85% range. A room with 80% room efficiency provides a buffer to 
assume that this room would be available 20% of the time beyond the planned operational 
practices for this room. This factor may be adjusted based on the actual and/or anticipated 
operations and processes of the room/department at a particular facility. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
Stop Code: A measure of workload including clinic stops forecasted by the Office of Policy 
and Planning (OPP) for all Strategic Planning Categories at Medical Center and Outpatient 
Clinic levels. 
Telehealth: The use of technology, such as computers and mobile devices, to manage 
healthcare remotely. It includes a variety of health care services, including but not limited to 
online support groups, online health information and self-management tools, email and 
online communication with health care providers, remote monitoring of vital signs, video, 
or online doctor visits. Depending on the concept of operations for this space, it may be 
equipped as an exam room or as a consult room with video/camera capability. 
Utilization Rate: A factor used in the calculation of a directly workload-driven room 
throughput. It represents, in a percent value, the room is idle based on the planning 
assumptions. For example, if a directly workload-driven room is available for use 8 hours a 
day, the Utilization Rate represents the assumed time it will be actually be used, an 85% 
utilization rate indicates, for planning purposes, the room will be used 6.8 hours a day. An 
additional directly workload-driven room will be provided in the calculation once the 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
269 – Recreation Therapy Service 
7 of 32 
previous room has reached 100% utilization. The utilization Rate is embedded in the Room 
Throughput value calculated in Section 3 of this document. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
Workstation: Area outfitted with equipment and furnishings, typically allocated 56 NSF 
each. Managers and other staff with no direct reports as well as part-time, seasonal, and 
job-sharing staff may qualify for a workstation. Such environments are particularly 
conducive to team-oriented office groupings. These environments work best when they 
have access to conference and small group meeting spaces. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space planning criteria included in this Standard have been specifically developed for 
this Department / Service in a Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare facility based 
on established VHA policy and guidelines to define the scope of services provided for 
the existing workload demand as well as that in the foreseeable future. Rooms and 
Functional Areas are provided based on research of clinical and non-clinical activities 
performed in this Department. 
B. Development / update of VA’s Program Guide (PG) standards is a research based effort 
executed with participation of VHA Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), VA-Construction and 
Facilities Management Office (CFM) professional staff and specialty consultants hired for 
the task. These space planning standards are based on current applicable VHA policies 
and guidelines, established and/or anticipated best practice standards, and latest 
medical technology developments. Workload metrics were tailored to satisfy current 
and anticipated veteran workload demand. 
C. The space planning component of PG-18-9 is based on the Space Planning Concept 
Matrix (SPCM) which lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and assigns room 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
269 – Recreation Therapy Service 
8 of 32 
quantity (Q) and area (NSF) for a series of ranges corresponding to the smallest to the 
largest department for this service in the VA healthcare system in incremental size; each 
range corresponds to a workload parameter which determines the number and area of 
each directly workload-driven room. The remainder of the rooms in the range i.e., 
waiting, storage, staff workstations, etc. are determined by ratios to the resulting 
number of or NSF of the workload-driven rooms. 
D. Sections 4 and 5 of these space planning standards as well as the PG-18-5 standard are 
implemented in the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) and hosted at the 
MAX.gov website so planners working on VA Construction projects can develop single or 
multi-department projects based on these PG-18-9- and the PG-18-5 standards. Output 
from SEPS is through Space and Contents Reports; the Space Report is the Program for 
Design (PFD), the Content Report is the Project Room Contents (PRC). Inclusion of a 
Functional Area as well as Room quantity (Q) and determination of the room area (NSF) 
in the PFD is based on the projected Workload input which triggers calculations included 
in the Room Criteria Statements (RCSs). The RCSs are placed immediately after each 
room name, room code and baseline area (NSF). The PRC list the medical equipment, 
furniture and fixtures associated to each Room Code in the project. The PFD & PRC are 
the baseline requirements for the planning phase of a VA project based on a site’s 
projected workload for the target planning year. This chapter’s corresponding PG-18-12, 
Design Guide -if available- is intended for use during the design phase of the project. 
E. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Recreation 
Therapy Service Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as the basis for this 
chapter. The Recreation Therapy Service SPCM lists all the spaces a VA Recreation 
Therapy Service site would require; the quantity and NSF for each room is calculated 
based on the Recreation Therapy Service projected workload or number of FTE positions 
authorized. The SPCM is organized in 10 ranges, each range represents an incremental 
workload value equivalent to a S, M or L Therapy space, this way all current VA 
Recreation Therapy Service sites are covered in the SPCM. The upper ranges are 
calculated for future facilities in case a higher projected workload Each range 
corresponds to an annual Recreation Therapy Service workload of 15,000 Stop Code 202 
encounters. The 10 SPCM ranges cover between 660 and 150,000 annual encounters. 
The Range workload values are used to generate the following therapy rooms: 
1. Recreation Therapy Groups Rooms: S, M & L, 
2. Activities of Daily Living, 
3. Creative Arts Groups Room: S, M & L, 
4. Adaptive Technology Group Room: S, M & L, 
5. Gymnasium: S, M &  L, 
6. Enclosed Gymnasium, 
7. Exercise/Weight Room: : S, M &  L, 
8. Wellness Room, 
9. Therapeutic Pool: S, M &  L, and 
10. Recreational Pool: S, M &  L. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
269 – Recreation Therapy Service 
9 of 32 
F. The SPCM metrics are translated into one (or more) Room Criteria Statement (RCS) for 
each room in Section 5 of this document. The SPCM Planning Range, the maximum 
number of directly workload-driven patient care rooms, in this document is 10. If a 
project shall require provision of workload driven rooms above the maximum range 
value refer to CFM for guidance. Rooms in this space planning document are organized 
in 5 Functional Areas (FAs). 
G. Based on its intended function, each room / space is assigned a: 
1. Room Name (RN), 
2. Room Code (RC), 
3. Room Area, the Net Square Feet (NSF) and its corresponding “soft metric” Net 
Square Meters (NSM), 
4. Unique Room Criteria Statement(s) (RCSs) correlated to answers to Input Data 
Statements (IDSs), and 
5. Room Comment as needed. 
H. The Room Codes included in this chapter stem from the VA Room Family. A unique 
support space, that may have variable area, is assigned a unique Room Code and adopts 
the square footage, as needed, correlated to the room contents assigned which in turn 
correspond to the range for those rooms. A unique clinical space or a direct clinical 
support room, i.e., control room, system components room, etc. typically does not 
feature variable NSF. Patient Care room names for rooms unique to this chapter end in 
“, Rec Thrpy Svc”. Patient Care Support room names end in “, Bldg Sprt”, “Clncl Sprt”, 
“Stff Sprt”, or “, Vet Sprt”, correlating to Building, Clinical, Staff or Veteran Support room 
families. 
I. Section 5, Sub-Section F lists the SEPS Importer Shortcuts used for implementation of 
Sections 4 & 5 in SEPS. These shortcuts are inserted into the Room Criteria Statement 
(RCS) for each room which upon upload into the Space and Equipment Planning System 
(SEPS) allowing planners developing VA healthcare projects to determine quantity and 
square footage of each room by performing mathematical or logical calculations. 
Shortcuts refer Input Data Statements (IDSs), Rooms or calculation parameters 
stemming from the SPCM. 
J. SEPS is accessible to government healthcare planners and private sector consultants 
working on VA HC projects during their Period of Performance (PoP) through the 
MAX.gov website; government provided Training is a requisite for access. 
K. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross factor (NTDG) factor of 1.30 for 
Recreation Therapy Service and a Building Gross factor of 1.35 in the space calculation 
to generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross Square 
Feet (BGSF) respectively for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square 
Feet (NSF) for each range. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the NTDG factor 
is fixed. 
L. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-5 Equipment Guidelist for the Room Content 
assignment for each room during the planning phase of a project.

6 PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. The Department Net to Gross Factor accounts for the space occupied by internal 
department circulation and interior partitions and other construction elements not 
defined by the net square foot area. 
B. Facility layout and design shall support patient confidentiality in areas where personal 
information is exchanged with staff. 
C. Recreation Therapy Service will share appropriate areas of other services, i.e., 
Rehabilitation Medicine Service, for use as desired for recreation therapy modalities 
where the level of usage is too low to justify constructing separate spaces. 
D. Outside storage (adjacent to outdoor activity area) is not to be included in the net 
square feet tabulation.  
E. When possible collocate the patient lockers, toilets / showers if Self-Directed and 
Aquatic Therapy services are located adjacent to each other. 
F. Refer to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management Technical Information Library (www.cfm.va.gov/til/) for additional 
technical criteria.

Average Length of Encounter (ALoE): Averaged length of time, in minutes, a patient spends 
in an Exam / Treatment Room interacting with a provider and the clinical support team. It is 
accounted from room “set-up” to “clean-up” by staff. This metric is used to determine the 
number of annual patient / provider encounters that take place in an Exam / Treatment 
Room which, in turn, is used to calculate the number of Exam / Treatment Rooms needed in 
a facility based on projected annual workload. The ALoE is determined with VHA SME input 
during a PG-18-9 clinical chapter revision / update. 
Average Length of Stay (ALoS): The average number of days a patient Veteran stays in an 
inpatient care unit. The ALoS is used to calculate the number of patient bedrooms for a 
specialty by dividing the site’s projected workload by the ALoS. 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Clinic Stop: Per these criteria, a clinic stop is the workload unit of measure for space 
planning. Clinic Stops are codified by VSSC, when applicable, they are referenced by number 
in the calculation of workload driven patient care spaces in this document. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Encounter: An interaction between a patient Veteran and a VA provider or providers in an 
Exam Room / Treatment Room / Consultation Room / Procedure Room, spaces where 
patient Veterans receive clinical care. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE)
: A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions.

logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Patient Unique: (or Unique Patient), A Veteran patient counted as a unique in each division 
from which they receive care. Patient Uniques are included in the Registry for a VA Medical 
Center. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs
’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Provider: An individual who examines, diagnoses, treats, prescribes medication, and 
manages the care of patients within his or her scope of practice as established by the 
governing body of a healthcare organization.

Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
Room Efficiency Factor: A factor that provides flexibility in the utilization of a room to 
account for patient delays, scheduling conflicts, and equipment maintenance. Common 
factors are in the 75% to 85% range. A room with 80% room efficiency provides a buffer to 
assume that this room would be available 20% of the time beyond the planned operational 
practices for this room. This factor may be adjusted based on the actual and/or anticipated 
operations and processes of the room/department at a particular facility. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
Stop Code: A 
measure of workload including clinic stops forecasted by the Office of Policy 
and Planning (OPP) for all Strategic Planning Categories at Medical Center and Outpatient 
Clinic levels.

Telehealth: The use of technology, such as computers and mobile devices, to manage 
healthcare remotely. It includes a variety of health care services, including but not limited to 
online support groups, online health information and self-management tools, email and 
online communication with health care providers, remote monitoring of vital signs, video, 
or online doctor visits. Depending on the concept of operations for this space, it may be 
equipped as an exam room or as a consult room with video/camera capability. 
Utilization Rate: A factor used in the calculation of a directly workload-driven room 
throughput. It represents, in a percent value, the room is idle based on the planning 
assumptions. For example, if a directly workload-driven room is available for use 8 hours a 
day, the Utilization Rate represents the assumed time it will be used, an 85% utilization rate 
indicates, for planning purposes, the room will be used 6.8 hours a day. An additional 
directly workload-driven room will be provided in the calculation once the previous room 
has reached 100% utilization. The utilization Rate is embedded in the Room Throughput 
value calculated in Section 3 of this document. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
Workstation: Area outfitted with equipment and furnishings, typically allocated 56 NSF 
each. Managers and other staff with no direct reports as well as part-time, seasonal, and 
job-sharing staff may qualify for a workstation. Such environments are particularly 
conducive to team-oriented office groupings. These environments work best when they 
have access to conference and small group meeting spaces.

C. Based on the workload parameters above, room quantity and area (NSF) for every room 
in each of the 34 PMR Svc ranges is determined in the PMR Svc SPCM. These values are 
reflected in the Room Criteria Statements (placed immediately below each room name, 
room code and NSF for each room in Section 5 of this document. Depending on the 
therapy specialty, each range represents an annual throughput based on values above. 
D. The 34 ranges were also correlated with PMR Svc historic values in VSSC’s Cube for the 
FY15-FY18 period. The workload values in the ranges for each therapy specialty cover 
the FY18 demand and provides growth capacity in each case for at least 50%, higher in 
case of Assistive Technology (ATech). Driver Training (DT) and Aquatic Therapy (AT) are 
provided if authorized for a project, no room quantity or NSF variability is allowed.

F. Section 4: Input Data Statements (IDSs) and Section 5: Space Planning Criteria in this 
Program Guide are implemented in the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) 
software hosted at MAX.gov. Planners working on VA PMR Svc projects can generate a 
Program for Design (PFD) by entering the projected Stop Code workload for each 
therapy specialty for the target year for the VA Station they are working on. The PFD 
generated by SEPS reflects the values in the SPCM and becomes the baseline space 
program to begin the project planning process. 
G. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross factor (NTDG) factor of 1.35 and a 
Building Gross factor of 1.35 in the space calculation to generate the Department Gross 
Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross Square Feet (BGSF) respectively for the 
project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet (NSF) for each range. Planners 
can adjust the BG factor in SEPS; the DG factor is not changeable. 
H. SEPS also generates the Project Room Contents (PRC) for each room in the project. The 
PRC includes the equipment, furniture and fixtures assigned to each room per VA256 ED 
PG-18-5: Equipment Guidelist. 
I. PG-18-12: Design Guide contains a Narrative, detailed functional diagrams, and detailed 
room templates for sixteen unique ED rooms. 
J. The PMR Svc space planning, equipment, and design Program Guides: PG-18-5, PG-18-9 
and PG-18-12 are available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction 
and Facilities Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website.

6 PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. Refer to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Construction Facilities 
Management (CFM) Handbooks, Standards, Standard Details, and Design Guides 
for technical criteria available at the VA Technical Information Library (TIL). 
B. Refer to Section 8: Functional Diagrams in this document for illustration of the 
following Planning and Design Considerations. 
C. Refer to Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation Service (PMR Svc) PG-18-12 Design 
Guide Section 2: Planning and Programming. 
D. Refer to Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation Service (PMR Svc) PG-18-5 Equipment 
Guidelist for assignment of Room Contents: Medical / Therapy Equipment, 
Furniture and Fixtures by Functional Area, Room Name & Room Code. 
E. GENERAL 
1. Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation Service (PMR Svc) utilizes an 
interdisciplinary team approach to provide comprehensive rehabilitation of 
the Veteran across an integrated health care system. An individualized care 
plan for each Veteran is developed and implemented to prevent, manage, or 
limit impairments and disabilities while improving the Veteran's functional 
PG-18-9 - SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  September 1, 2022 
270 - Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Service 
58 of 64 
abilities, independence, and quality of life. 
2. Refer to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Construction and 
Facilities Management Technical Information Library (www.cfm.va.gov/til/) for 
additional technical criteria. 
F. RECEPTION AREA 
1. The Reception Area accommodates the initial greeting, processing, and admission 
of Veterans for PMR treatment. It includes staffed check-in stations and electronic 
check-in stations. The waiting area provides a variety of seating for families and 
Veterans seeking privacy. The inclusive design of this area provides open space 
next to seating allowing chair users to sit next to family. To the extent possible, 
this area must provide access to natural daylight and views outside. The path to 
reception from parking and the building entry should be as short as possible to 
accommodate Veterans with limited mobility. 
G. COMMON PATIENT AREA 
1. The Common Patient Area refers to rooms that are generally available for 
Veterans seeking therapy from every discipline and includes Exam Rooms, 
Specialty Care Exam Rooms, Procedure Rooms, Treatment Rooms, and Consult 
Rooms. 
2. Rooms in this area are zoned to allow for intake of Veterans before 
proceeding to therapy during their treatment session. These rooms may 
also be located adjacent to Physical Therapy (PT), Occupational Therapy 
(OT), and Kinesiotherapy (KT) treatment areas. 
3. Cardiopulmonary Rehab space can be provided for recovering cardiac patients. 
4. Multi-Purpose Group Rooms provide flexible spaces for various staff and Veteran 
uses, including teleconferencing, staff meetings, and Veteran education. 
H. PHYSICAL THERAPY (PT) AREA 
1. The PT Area includes an Open Treatment Areaa with treatment stations, gait 
lanes, and equipment, as well as curtained and fully enclosed treatment 
areas for Veteran privacy. 
2. PT Open Treatment Areas are zoned by treatment and equipment type and must 
have access to natural daylight and exterior views to the extent possible. The 
center of the PT Open Treatment Area has a grid of floor power/data outlets to 
provide for equipment that can change over time. Dynamic body-weight support 
lifts located in gait lines coordinate with floor markings to provide training space 
for Veterans regaining mobility. 
3. The PT Open Treatment Area requires a minimum ceiling height of 10 feet to 
effectively host the lift equipment and clearance for tools such as therapy stairs. 
The PT Open Treatment Area incorporates a variety of equipment and supply 
storage in dedicated rooms and alcoves. Therapist workspace is directly adjacent 
and includes interior glazing for monitoring of patients. Direct access to outdoor 
PG-18-9 - SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  September 1, 2022 
270 - Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Service 
59 of 64 
therapy space is ideal. 
I. KINESIOTHERAPY (KT) AREA 
1. The KT Open Treatment Area hosts equipment to support the exercise-based 
discipline that is intrinsically tied to physical therapy. KT and PT use much of the 
same equipment, and the care is often part of a collaborative approach 
between the disciplines. At many facilities, PT and KT share an Open Treatment 
Area. If the projected need for KT is great enough to warrant a dedicated area, 
organize the KT Open Treatment Area in distinct zones for cardiovascular 
equipment, strength training equipment, and gait training equipment. 
2. The KT Open Treatment Area can also include cubicles and individual 
treatment rooms for more private therapy as well as a group room for 
activities that accommodate multiple Veterans. 
J. OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY (OT) AREA 
1. In the OT Open Treatment Area, Veterans work on motor skills for everyday life 
activities. It should directly connect to the PT Open Treatment Area to promote 
collaboration and allow each discipline to share equipment as needed in a 
Veteran’s course of therapy. 
2. The OT Open Treatment Area is an adaptable, open space with zones for tablebased
therapy and Treatment Stations for equipment-based therapy. Its location 
should provide direct access to outdoor space, as well as daylight and views to 
the exterior. 
3. The OT Open Treatment Area is zoned by equipment type and activity, with open 
spaces organized near a window wall and quiet, enclosed spaces located at an 
inner edge of the gym. The equipment zone is in the middle of the open gym. 
Equipment will vary for each site, and the program needs at one place define the 
specific equipment required. 
4. The Activities of Daily Living (ADL) area combines aspects of the Veteran’s home 
environment for therapy and skills training on everyday life activities such as 
eating, bathing, dressing, toileting, and transferring. It includes an Indoor 
Training Vehicle Station, which utilizes a non-operating vehicle to practice 
entering and exiting a car. Additionally, training space is provided for community 
and commercial activities such as banking and shopping. 
K. CHIROPRACTIC CARE (CC) AREA 
1. The CC Area provides private space for one-on-one treatment, similar in layout to 
the rooms in the Patient Area. The CC Exam/Treatment Room is equipped to 
provide an examination, manual therapy, and non-invasive or minimally invasive 
procedures. 
L. AQUATIC THERAPY (AT) AREA 
1. The AT Area includes a Pool that is sized to accommodate multiple Veterans doing 
one-on-one therapy or group activities, in addition to a deep portion that can be 
PG-18-9 - SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  September 1, 2022 
270 - Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Service 
60 of 64 
used for adaptive sport activities, such as flipping a kayak. In addition to the Pool, 
the AT Area includes a Treadmill Pool with a floor that can raise to deck height 
and then lower in depth for a variety of treatment activities. 
2. The Pool can be configured with a flat floor or slope to several depths, depending 
on the specific need of the station, its Veteran population, and the programmed 
therapy activities. The deep pool can be used in concert with a flat floor pool to 
provide for group activities as well as focused training in the deep pool as 
needed. The Pool includes multiple means of access for users of different ability 
and to simulate real-world conditions for training. 
3. The AT Area includes Locker, Shower, and Toilet Rooms for Veterans, as 
well as equipment storage, and mechanical/plumbing areas that support 
the space. 
4. Water temperature and ambient temperature are vital considerations for the 
therapy environment and must be considered in context of the region and 
climate the AT Area is planned for. 
5. The AT Area should have access to daylight and exterior views to the extent 
possible. Maintenance and safety considerations include slip-free and moistureresistant
materials and finishes, lighting location, and emergency access around 
the Pool Deck.  
M. DRIVER TRAINING (DT) AREA 
1. The DT Area is a combination of interior space for driving simulation and 
outdoor space for “behind the wheel” training. The indoor training areas must 
have close access to the exterior areas.  
2. The Simulator Station incorporates a steering wheel, seating, pedals, and 
monitors to provide a computerized driving simulation. It is used for Veteran 
training and for assessment of range of motion, strength, coordination, and 
reaction time. 
3. The Outdoor Training Vehicle Area provides working vehicles for training. The 
amount of space is defined by the number and type of vehicles provided by the 
service. Each vehicle must have a dedicated space that replicates standard 
accessible parking space dimensions and striped access zones. 
N. ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY (ATech) AREA 
1. Dedicated ATech space is generally included in the design of extensive PMR Svc 
facilities, and those serving an area of the Veteran population where the demand 
for device fabrication and training is sufficiently high. 
2. The training and use of assistive technology are components of Occupational 
Therapy (OT). The ATech Area contains a variety of spaces to facilitate 
creating, fitting, and training with assistive devices. In addition, all interior 
rooms must be telehealth-ready and have a reliable Wi-Fi connection.

61 of 64 
O. WHEELCHAIR CLINIC AREA 
1. The Wheelchair Clinic Area is equipped to perform evaluations to fit the Veteran 
with the appropriate wheelchair or modifications to his or her current wheelchair 
and adjust as needed. Once the fitting or repair is complete, Veterans typically 
receive training in the room. They may also leave the room for mobility 
assessments in various settings, returning for further adjustments as needed. 
2. Ideal adjacencies include the Assistive Technology Area and Activities of Daily 
Living rooms. Mobility assessments are often conducted outside the Wheelchair 
Clinic Area, in locations that provide a variety of settings and surfaces to 
maneuver. The Wheelchair Clinic requires a large amount of storage for 
wheelchairs and wheelchair accessories.

2 of 3 
1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document provides Space Planning Criteria for Chapter 274: Quarters, On-Call. It 
applies to all medical facilities at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
Quarters include sleeping space with bath and auxiliary areas for use by residents and/or 
physicians. On-call facilities specifically provided for intensive care units, ambulatory care 
and Surgical Service are not included in this chapter. 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the

additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning system (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
274 – Quarters, On-Call 
3 of 4 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
274 – Quarters, On-Call 
4 of 5 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Quarters OnCall
Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as a basis for this chapter. The 
SPCM lists all the spaces a VA Quarters On-Call site would require; the quantity and NSF 
for each room is calculated based on the number of Resident FTE positions authorized 
for the facility and whether the facility is Affiliated. The number of Resident FTE 
positions authorized is organized in twelve ranges from 2 to 175 FTE positions 
incrementally. 
B. The room quantity (Q) and area (NSF) values included for each range in the SPCM are 
reflected in the Room Criteria Statements, placed immediately below each room name, 
room code and NSF/NSM, for each room in Section 5 of this document. The number of 
facility Resident FTE positions authorized is included in the Input Data Statements (IDSs) 
in Section 4. Both Sections are implemented in the Space Planning and Equipment 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
274 – Quarters, On-Call 
5 of 6 
System (SEPS) software accessible through the MAX.gov website. Planners programming 
a VA Quarters On-Call project shall develop a baseline Program for Design (PFD) in SEPS. 
C. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross (NTDG) factor of 1.30 for Quarters OnCall
and a Building Gross (BG) factor of 1.35 in the space calculation. These factors 
generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross Square Feet 
(BGSF) for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet (NSF) for all 
Departments included. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the NTDG factor is 
fixed. 
D. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website.

1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines space planning criteria for Radiation Oncology Service. It applies to 
all medical facilities at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
2 DEFINITIONS 
Block / Mold Room: A dedicated fabrication area where customized patient-specific 
shielding and positioning devices are created. This includes the production of beam-shaping 
blocks, which are cast from molten alloy to shield normal tissues from radiation based on 
treatment plans developed by the radiation oncologist. The room is also used to fabricate 
other supportive devices such as stents, bite blocks, bolus, and immobilization aids that 
help ensure consistent and accurate patient positioning during treatment. The need for a 
block/mold room varies by facility and is dependent on the technology used.
Brachytherapy: Brachytherapy is a form of radiation treatment that utilizes radioactive 
seed/pellets and/or tiny x-ray tubes. These seeds, pellets and/or x-ray tubes are about 1 cm 
in length or less and are implanted into the tissue, into a body cavity (classified as interstitial 
and intra cavitary treatments respectively) or placed on the skin surface. Implants can be 
either temporary or permanent. These procedures are clean/sterile and require specialized 
shielded rooms for treatment and isotope preparation and storage. Brachytherapy can be 
used alone or in combination with other treatments such as external beam radiation 
therapy or surgery.
Bunker / Vault: A specially designed, shielded room constructed to contain high levels of 
ionizing radiation produced by devices such as LINACSs, high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy 
afterloaders, or other radiation-emitting equipment. Its primary purpose is to protect staff, 
patients, and the public from unnecessary radiation exposure during treatment.
C-Arm Linear Accelerator: In 2025, most linear accelerators being used are C-Arm type. It is 
a type of medical device used in radiation therapy that delivers high-energy X-rays or 
electrons to treat cancer. It is named for its C-shaped gantry, which allows the treatment 
head to rotate around the patient, enabling radiation to be delivered from multiple angles. 
This flexibility helps to precisely target tumors while minimizing radiation to surrounding 
healthy tissue. C-Arm LINACs support advanced treatment techniques such as IntensityModulated
Radiation Therapy (IMRT), Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT), and 
Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT). 
C-Arm Simulator Unit: An imaging device historically used in radiation therapy to replicate 
the geometric setup of treatment delivery. Utilizing fluoroscopy and radiographic imaging, 
the simulator allows clinicians to visualize internal anatomy, evaluate potential treatment 
field sizes, and define target volumes and critical structures.
CT Simulation: The process in which a computed tomography (CT) scanner is used to acquire 
detailed, volumetric images of a patient in the treatment position. Cross sectional images 
form the basis for dosimetric planning, allowing clinicians to accurately define target 
volumes and critical structures for radiation delivery. The term simulator refers to the 
capability of recreating or “simulating” the planned treatment virtually using patientPG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  August 1, 2025
277 – Radiation Oncology Service
3 of 30
specific imaging data. CT simulators are required for nearly all radiation oncology patient 
workflows.
Dosimetric Treatment Planning: Computerized process of designing a patient-specific 
radiation therapy plan, similar in concept to computer aided design systems used in 
architecture and engineering. Using imaging data from CT, PET/CT, or MRI simulation, 
treatment planning systems generate a three-dimensional model of the patient’s anatomy 
and tumor volumes. The plan accounts for the specific LINAC to be used, including its 
geometry, beam angles, and motion capabilities. Through manual, automated, or hybrid 
optimization techniques, planners calculate the optimal radiation dose distribution to 
maximize coverage of the target volume while minimizing exposure to surrounding healthy 
tissue.
Fractional Treatment: The delivery of radiation therapy in multiple individual sessions, 
known as fractions. Patients typically receive between 1 to 45 fractions per treatment series 
in a 10–30-minute session. This approach allows healthy tissue time to recover between 
treatments while maintaining therapeutic effectiveness against cancer cells. Shorter, highprecision
regimens include Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS), typically a single fraction to a 
neurologic site, and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT), generally 1-5 fractions.
Image Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT): A technique used to improve the accuracy and 
precision of radiation delivery by imaging and aligning the patient based on internal 
anatomy rather than relying on external skin markings. IGRT allows clinicians to visualize 
internal structures. sometimes including the tumor itself, immediately before or during 
treatment to ensure proper positioning. IGRT can utilize various imaging modalities such as 
planar X-rays, Cone Beam CT (CBCT), or MRI, depending on the clinical need and technology 
available.
Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT): An advanced form of external beam 
radiation therapy that delivers highly conformal radiation doses to complex tumor shapes 
while minimizing exposure to surrounding healthy tissue. IMRT achieves this by modulating 
both the intensity and shape of the radiation beam across multiple angles of delivery. IMRT 
is delivered using standard medical LINACS equipped with multi-leaf collimators (MLCs) that 
dynamically shape and adjust the beam in real time. 
Linear Accelerator: A linear accelerator (LINAC) is the primary medical device used to deliver 
external beam radiation therapy. It generates high-energy X-rays or electrons by 
accelerating charged particles through a linear tube using microwave technology. These 
beams are shaped and directed with sub-millimeter precision to target tumors while 
minimizing radiation exposure to surrounding healthy tissue. LINAC installation requires 
specialized room design to support its weight, power needs, and shielding requirements.
Maze / Mazeless: Access to the LINAC rooms or other “bunkers/vaults” can be either 
indirect (i.e., through a maze) or direct (i.e., mazeless) designs. Mazes require a longer 
distance for the patients and radiation therapists to travel to the treatment machine. Mazes 
were typically used to control radiation exposure in public areas and reduce the size of the 
treatment room doors. Mazeless designs require larger doors and save time by reducing the 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  August 1, 2025
277 – Radiation Oncology Service
4 of 30
recurrent entry and exit from the LINAC room. Choice of access is also dependent on the 
highest photon energy produced by the LINAC.
MRI Simulation: The process in which a scanner utilizing MRI technology is used to obtain 
high-contrast, soft tissue images in anatomically complex regions. MRI simulation may be 
used in addition to or instead of CT simulation when enhanced tissue visualization is 
beneficial. MRI simulators are typically used in workflows involving MR-guided linear 
accelerators (MR LINACs), and all immobilization devices used must be compatible. MRI 
simulation rooms require unique design considerations, including both magnetic safety and 
radiation safety.
PET/CT Simulation: The process in which a scanner utilizing positron emission tomography 
(PET) and computed tomography (CT) technology is used to acquire images of a patient in 
the treatment position. While the CT component provides detailed anatomical data, the PET 
component adds physiological information to improve tumor targeting. PET/CT may be used 
in place of, or in addition to, standard CT simulation. PET/CT simulation requires shielded 
rooms to accommodate high-energy PET tracers (511 keV), spaces for safe storage and 
handling of radiopharmaceuticals, patient injection areas, and quiet rooms for isotope 
uptake.
Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS): The digital capture, transfer, and 
storage of radiologic images. A PACS system consists of workstations for interpretation, 
image/data producing modalities, a web server for distribution, printers for file records, 
image servers for information transfer and holding, and an archive of off-line information. A 
computer network is needed to support each of these devices.
Radiation Therapy: Ionizing radiation is used to treat both malignant and benign disease. 
The radiation used can be photon (x-rays or gamma rays) or high energy particles 
(electrons, protons, or other particles). Radiation Therapy works by taking advantage of the 
increased sensitivity of rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, compared to the lower 
sensitivity of normal tissues. Modern radiation therapy uses advanced treatment design 
techniques (see Dosimetric Treatment Planning) to precisely deliver radiation to the tumor 
while minimizing exposure to surrounding healthy structures. This is achieved through 
methods such as beam modulation, cross-firing from multiple angles, and image-guided 
targeting.
Ring Gantry Linear Accelerator: A form of cancer radiation therapy that combines the 
precision of a CT scan with the potency of radiation treatment to selectively destroy 
cancerous tumors while avoiding surrounding tissue. Ring Gantry Linear Accelerators rotate 
the beam source around the patient, thus allowing the beam to enter the patient from 
many different angles in succession. Thus, the tumor is precisely targeted and the healthy 
tissue surrounding the tumor is subjected to much lower doses of radiation.
Superficial Radiation Therapy: The use of low-energy X-rays to treat cancers or other lesions 
located close to the surface of the body. This treatment typically uses either a superficial Xray
machine (delivering X-rays in the 10–100 kilovolt range) or an orthovoltage machine 
(100–500 kilovolts). These low-penetration beams are ideal for targeting shallow tumors, 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  August 1, 2025

5 of 30
such as skin cancers, while minimizing exposure to deeper tissues. In some cases, electron 
beams from a linear accelerator may also be used for treating superficial lesions, as 
electrons deposit most of their energy near the skin surface.
Surface-Guided Radiation Therapy (SGRT): Technology used to monitor and guide patient 
positioning in real time during both simulation and treatment. It utilizes a system of optical 
cameras, typically mounted on the ceiling or walls, that continuously capture and track the 
patient’s external surface anatomy. This technology can improve treatment precision, 
reduce patient setup time, and enhance patient comfort.
Teletherapy: Teletherapy or external beam therapy is a form of radiation treatment that 
utilizes accelerators to treat disease from a distance. Radiation beams (either 
electromagnetic or high energy particles) penetrate the patient and deliver radiation dose 
to diseased tissue. This is the primary form of radiation treatment used. External beam 
therapy is non-invasive and can be used in combination with surgery, chemotherapy, and 
immunotherapy.
Theranostics: A two-step treatment approach that combines diagnostic imaging and 
targeted therapy using similar molecular agents. In the first step, a small amount of a 
radioactive compound (radiotracer) is used to detect the presence of disease through 
imaging techniques like PET scans. This step confirms whether the tracer binds to the 
tumor. If it does, a second, similar compound labeled with a higher dose of radiation is 
given to deliver targeted therapy, using radiation to destroy the cancer cells while limiting 
damage to healthy tissue.
Treatment Course: A patient’s radiation therapy treatment course is typically divided into 
multiple individual sessions or fractions. The number of fractions can range from 1-45, 
depending on diagnosis and treatment intent. Treatment courses often include a primary 
phase, targeting the full tumor volume, followed by a boost phase, which delivers additional 
radiation to a smaller, high-risk area within the original target.
Treatment Room: Specialized rooms that require shielding with lead (1/16” to several 
inches) or concrete (up to 8 feet thick) for protection of patients, staff, and the public from 
radiation exposure. The design of the treatment room is customized based on energy 
output, beam geometry, use frequency, and workload of the machine. A shielding expert 
(typically a medical physicist) performs detailed calculations to ensure regulatory 
compliance and radiation safety. In addition to shielding, treatment rooms have specific 
requirements for structural load bearing, electrical systems, HVAC, data and control cabling, 
and system integration. Please refer to the manufacturer for specifics regarding room 
design.
Space Planning / SEPS
Accessible: A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with provisions outlined 
in the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA).

elements, financed with federal funds, to comply with the Architectural Barriers Act 
Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). The ABAAS replaces the Uniform Federal Accessibility 
Standards (UFAS).
Average Length of Encounter (ALoE): Averaged length of time, in minutes, a patient spends in 
an Exam / Treatment Room interacting with a provider and the clinical support team. It is 
accounted from room “set-up” to “clean-up” by staff. This metric is used to determine the 
number of annual patient / provider encounters that take place in an Exam / Treatment Room 
which, in turn, is used to calculate the number of Exam / Treatment Rooms needed in a 
facility based on projected annual workload. The ALoE is determined with VHA SME input 
during a PG-18-9 clinical chapter revision / update.
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross Square 
Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This factor 
accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, horizontal and 
vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, shafts, and 
mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 1.35 and 
included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) in SEPS.

and Patient Care Support   chapters; they are implemented, deployed, and accessible in the 
SEPS software.
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs Design Program Guide (PG) standard for VA 
healthcare facilities, it provides design guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and 
Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs), and Veteran Centers. This PG is also referred as 
the Design Guide and provides a narrative section dealing with the facility design 
requirements, and a graphic section, the Room Template, for key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all 
PG-18-9 chapters have a corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover 
more than one PG-18-9 chapter.
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and square

determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project.
Room Efficiency Factor: A factor that provides flexibility in the utilization of a room to account 
for patient delays, scheduling conflicts, and equipment maintenance. Common factors are in 
the 75% to 85% range. A room with 80% room efficiency provides a buffer to assume that this 
room would be available 20% of the time beyond the planned operational practices for this 
room. This factor may be adjusted based on the actual and/or anticipated operations and 
processes of the room/department at a particular facility.
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions.
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. This 
format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. Shortcuts 
allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making full use of 
their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a room in any FA 
or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are listed along with 
their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section.
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range defined 
in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges reflecting 
existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space Planning 
Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM.
Stop Code: A measure of workload including clinic stops forecasted by the Office of Policy and 
Planning (OPP) for all Strategic Planning Categories at Medical Center and Outpatient Clinic 
levels.
Telehealth: The use of technology, such as computers and mobile devices, to manage 
healthcare remotely. It includes a variety of health care services, including but not limited to 
online support groups, online health information and self-management tools, email and 
online communication with health care providers, remote monitoring of vital signs, video, or 
online doctor visits. Depending on the concept of operations for this space, it may be 
equipped as an Exam Room or as a Consult Room with video/camera capability.
Utilization Rate: A factor used in the calculation of a directly workload-driven room 
throughput. It represents, in percentage value, the room is idle based on the planning 
assumptions. For example, if a directly workload-driven room is available for use 8 hours a 
day, the Utilization Rate represents the assumed time it will be used, an 85% utilization rate 
indicates, for planning purposes, the room will be used 6.8 hours a day. An additional directly 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  August 1, 2025
277 – Radiation Oncology Service
9 of 30
workload-driven room will be provided in the calculation once the previous room has reached 
100% utilization. The utilization Rate is embedded in the Room Throughput value calculated in 
Section 3 of this document.
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 Room 
Contents assigned to the room.
VA Technical Information Library Management System (TIL-MS): A resource website 
maintained by the Facilities Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) containing a broad range of technical publications related to the 
planning, design, leasing, and construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: 
https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality.
Workstation: Area outfitted with equipment and furnishings, typically allocated 56 NSF each. 
Managers and other staff with no direct reports as well as part-time, seasonal, and jobsharing
staff may qualify for a workstation. Such environments are particularly conducive to 
team-oriented office groupings. These environments work best when they have access to 
conference and small group meeting spaces.
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Development of VA’s Program Guide (PG) standards is a research-based effort executed 
with participation of the corresponding Program Office, VHA, VA-Construction and 
Facilities Management Office (CFM) professional staff, and Space Planning Consultant 
Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) hired for the task.
B. Space planning criteria detailed in this document have been specifically developed for 
the Radiation Oncology Service Department in a VA healthcare facility based on 
established VHA policy, guidelines, and input from VA Radiation Oncology Program 
Office.
C. Rooms and Functional Areas are provided based on requirements of Radiation Oncology 
Patient Care and Patient Care Support activities performed in this Department.
D. These space planning standards including room throughputs and workload metrics are 
based on established and/or anticipated best practices, and latest medical technology.
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  August 1, 2025
277 – Radiation Oncology Service
10 of 30
E. The space planning criteria parameters in Section 5 of this document is based on the 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM) developed in response to the Program Office 
requirements which include current and expected modalities.
F. The SPCM lists all the rooms required for the provision of care and treatment organized 
by Functional Area. Radiation Oncology Service is organized in ten Functional Areas 
(FAs) as follows:
1. Reception Area
2. Patient Examination Area
3. Simulation Area
4. Treatment Planning Area
5. Patient Treatment Area
6. Clinical Support Area
7. Clinical Staff Area
8. Support Area
9. Staff and Administrative Area, and
10. Building Support Area
G. Each FA contains a series of rooms / spaces for patient-care or patient-care support 
functions. Each room is assigned a Room Name (RM NM), Room Count (RM CT), and 
Room NSF (RM NSF). The room naming convention incorporates the room function and 
the VA Room Family it belongs separated by a comma, for example Standard Linear 
Accelerator (LINAC) Room, Rad Onc Svc. Besides rooms in the Rad Onc Svc family, a 
Patient Care family, the remaining rooms belong to PC-Support families: Clinical 
Support, Staff Support, Education Svc, Logistics Svc, Env Management Svc, and Building 
Support families.
H. The SPCM provides RM CT & RM NSF values for the following five groups of conditions:
1. Radiation Oncology + CT Simulator without Brachytherapy (default),
2. Radiation Oncology + PET/CT Simulator without Brachytherapy,
3. Radiation Oncology + PET/CT Simulator + MRI Simulator without Brachytherapy,
4. Radiation Oncology + CT Simulator with Brachytherapy provided, and
5. Radiation Oncology + CT Simulator + MRI Simulator without Brachytherapy.
Besides the conditions above, each of these groups provides up to four LINACs in four 
corresponding increments or ranges as follows:
One LINAC authorized triggers one Standard LINAC in range 1 (default),
Two LINACs authorized triggers an additional Standard LINAC in range 2,
Three LINACs authorized triggers one MRI LINAC in range 3, and
Four LINACs authorized triggers an additional Standard LINAC in range 4
The RM CT & RM NSF of the remaining rooms in each range correspond to the total 
number of LINACs in each incremental range, and the Group Conditions 1 through 5 
above.
I. The driver of the RM CT and RM NSF for all the rooms in all Functional Areas is the 
number of LINACs, the type of Simulator and whether Brachytherapy is authorized. 
(Refer to Section 4: Input Data Statements). The number of condition combinations 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  August 1, 2025
277 – Radiation Oncology Service
11 of 30
results in a tailored Program for Design (PFD) in responses to the Input Data Statements 
reflecting the functional requirements of a site.
J. Sections 4 and 5 of this Standard are implemented in the Space and Equipment Planning 
System (SEPS) software tool, Planners working on Radiation Oncology Service projects 
can develop a baseline Program for Design (PFD) for a VA site in SEPS based on these 
standards and their project requirements. The resulting PFD can be fine-tuned to reflect 
specific requirements for the site during project development. Room Counts and Room 
NSFs in a baseline Program for Design correspond to the incremental values for each 
Range developed in the SPCM.
K. Additionally, the Equipment Guidelist standard (PG-18-5) is also implemented in SEPS to 
generate a baseline Project Room Contents (PRC) List which includes medical 
equipment, furniture, and fixtures. This chapter’s corresponding PG-18-12, Design 
Guide-when available- will be posted at VA-CFM’s Technical Information Library 
Management System (TIL-MS) where PG-18-9 and PG-18-5 are also posted for 
reference.
L. Section 5, Sub-Section K lists the SEPS Importer Shortcuts used for implementation of 
Sections 4 & 5 in SEPS. These shortcuts are inserted into the Room Criteria Statement 
(RCS) for each room as needed.
M. SEPS is accessible to government healthcare planners, and private sector consultants 
working on VA healthcare projects during their Period of Performance (PoP) through the 
SEPS.VA.gov website; government provided Training is a requisite for access to the 
software.
N. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross factor (NTDG) factor of 1.40 for Radiation 
Oncology Service and a Building Gross factor of 1.35 in the space calculation to generate 
the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross Square Feet (BGSF) 
respectively for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet (NSF) for 
each range. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the NTDG factor is fixed. The 
Radiation Oncology Service NTDG for this Standard was updated based on area Takeoffs
of recent VA projects and by including the LINAC Room shielding as NSF in the 
Standard and MRI LINAC room aggregate NSF.
O. Refer to the corresponding PG-18-5 Equipment Guidelist for the Room Content 
assignment for each room during the planning phase of a project.
P. Refer to the corresponding PG-18-12: Design Guide, if available, during the planning and 
design phases of a project. Not all PG-18-9 clinical chapters have a corresponding PG-1812
document, please refer to the VA-TIL.
Q. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website.

6 PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. Planning and Design of a Radiation Oncology facility requires special expertise, 
knowledge, and experience. The design team should engage and seek input from the 
Radiation Oncologist lead, Physicist, selected equipment manufacturer Technical 
Representative, etc. early in the process and particularly from schematic planning to CD 
for the specific requirements of the Standard LINAC, and MRI LINAC, Simulation, and 
Brachytherapy rooms and their specific shielding and geometry requirements for the 
success of the project.
B. The preferred location of a Radiation Oncology facility is at a ground level for ease of 
access for patients and for servicing / maintenance / calibration of the Linear 
Accelerator(s) and Simulator(s).
C. Reception and Waiting areas must be clearly identified at the facility entrance. Design of 
the Reception should allow for patient confidentiality. Direct line of sight from the 
Reception to Waiting, Patient Education Workstation and Refreshment Center must be 
provided.
D. Patient Consultation / Examination rooms are provided for patient and providers / 
radiation oncologist(s) interactions pre and for post treatment as well as follow up 
assessments. A Procedure Room is provided for minor procedures. Additionally, Social 
Workers, dietitians, and other members of the extended care team also use these 
rooms for patient visits. Direct connection to the Treatment Area shall be provided.
E. Simulation is a critical preparation step for the actual treatment. The treatment is 
simulated by positioning the patient in the same position the treatment will take place. 
CT, PET/CT, or MRI scans will be performed for a detailed reading of the anatomy of the 
area to be treated.

F. Dosimetry is the determination of a radiation dose; it is performed by a Medical 
Physicist and a Radiation Dosimetrist. This process involves measurement and 
calculation of the absorbed dose of radiation energy by a body mass of a tissue. This is 
performed in the Dosimetry / Treatment Planning room.
G. Patient treatment is performed in the Standard or MRI LINAC Rooms. In either case, 
precise laser guided interventions are performed to deliver high energy x-rays or 
electrons to conform to a tumor’s shape. in areas under treatment. The LINAC 
equipment must be precision mounted to allow rotation and movement of the gantry. 
The room 3-D geometry corresponding to the equipment to be used is key in the 
planning and design of a LINAC room. Verify room key dimensions and equipment 
layouts with equipment vendors during schematic design.
H. LINAC rooms require appropriate shielding to protect surrounding areas from radiation 
generated by the LINAC equipment. As LINAC rooms are maze less, adequate shielded 
door must be provided along with a mechanical system for opening / closing. The 
shielding square footage required in the LINACs has been accounted as NSF and is 
included in LINAC aggregate NSF, this has allowed a more accurate determination of the 
Departmental Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor. Additionally, LINAC rooms require Equipment 
/ Power Conditioning, and Control rooms which must be completely enclosed and 
accessible from the LINAC access way (not directly from the LINAC). The Control Room 
and the LINAC room are connected via audio and video systems. Refer to FA 5 RMs 9-13, 
and RMs 14-18 for Standard and MRI LINAC NSF values.
I. Brachytherapy is a form of radiation therapy that involves placing radioactive implants 
near or inside a tumor for intense targeted radiation for a short time. This procedure is 
performed in the shielded Brachytherapy Treatment Room. A Control Room is also 
provided. Refer to FA5 RMs 20 – 27 for treatment and supporting spaces.
J. Superficial and Orthovoltage therapy – Two treatment modalities that may be 
considered are Superficial and Orthovoltage therapy. Superficial x-ray units are low 
energy (10-100 kVp) and are often mobile. They can be placed in the CT simulator room, 
an HDR vault or even the linear accelerator room (although this defeats one of their 
main benefits of saving time on the linear accelerator). Superficial machines could also 
be placed in an appropriately shielded procedure room in some cases. Orthovoltage 
machines which can have energies of 100-300 kV require more significant shielding and 
therefore more consideration. An HDR treatment room, if present in the design, has 
adequate shielding for orthovoltage energies and output. Placing an ortho-voltage 
machine in a linear accelerator vault is possible but again eliminates the advantage of 
saving time on more expensive linear accelerators for patient treatment. A dedicated 
ortho-voltage room is also a possibility. These machines are relatively small, and both 
require radiation safety consideration. The manufacturers and a radiation shielding 
expert should be consulted to optimally place superficial and orthovoltage equipment 
within a radiation oncology department design.

K. The Clinical Staff area includes office, workstations, breakroom, lockers, and toilets for 
the Radiation Oncology staff.
L. The Support area includes Equipment and Supply rooms, Full and Empty Gas Cylinder 
Storage rooms, Service Entrance Vestibule to facilitate maintenance and service for the 
treatment equipment.
M. The Staff and Administrative area include office space for HSS and AO, administrative 
staff workstations and a Staff Conference room.
N. The Building Support area includes the Telecommunications Room (TR), and Mechanical 
and Electrical rooms, the area for these two rooms is accounted in the Department Net 
to Gross factor.
O. Corridors should be designed a minimum of 8 feet in width, to accommodate the 
passage of two stretchers and/or wheelchairs, equipment, or beds. Provide 6-foot 
corridors in non-patient zones / areas.
P. Refer to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Facilities Management 
Handbooks, Standards, Standard Details, and Design Guides for technical criteria.

and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM.

each. Managers and other staff with no direct reports as well as part-time, seasonal, and 
job-sharing staff may qualify for a workstation. Such environments are particularly 
conducive to team-oriented office groupings. These environments work best when they 
have access to conference and small group meeting spaces. 
3. OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Workload driven space planning criteria have been developed for the functional groups 
of the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Research and Development (ORD). 
These criteria are predicated on established and/or anticipated best practice standards 
as well as applicable policy requirements for biomedical, rehabilitation, clinical, and 
health services research as well as the supporting veterinary services. They are the 
baseline space programs for the Research and Development components of a VA 
construction project. These criteria are subject to modification and adjustment relative 
to developments in state-of-the-art equipment, research type, and subsequent detailed 
planning and design. 
B. Update of the Space Planning and Design Standards is a research based effort executed 
with participation of VHA Office of Research and Development (ORD) Subject Matter 
Experts, VA-Construction and Facilities Management Office (CFM) professional staff and 
specialty consultants hired for the task. The functional groups and spaces contained 
herein were based on a review of current applicable VHA policies and guidelines, and 
technology developments. 
C. Research activities of VA Research and Development (R&D) take place in the following 
main components: 
1. Biomedical Laboratory Research and Development (BLR&D) Service, 
2. Rehabilitation Research and Development (RR&D) Service, 
3. Clinical Science Research and Development (CSR&D) Service, 
4. Health Services Research and Development (HSR&D) Service, and 
5. Veterinary Medical Unit (VMU) 
These components are referenced either by their full name, their abbreviation in 
parenthesis followed by Service (except for VMU) or their abbreviation as needed 
throughout this document. 
D. The Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) details all the baseline set of spaces for the 
above components organized in 30 ranges for BLR&D and VMU, and in one range each 
for RR&D, CSR&D, and HSR&D. The BLR&D and VMU ranges are based on the number of 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  June 1, 2022 
278 – Research and Development (R&D) 
7 of 52 
Principal Investigators (PIs) working on a site/facility; each range represents 3 PIs and 
their support personnel. The SPCM details space requirements for a facility ranging from 
3 to 90 PIs. For the other three R&D components, the SPCM provides a set of 26 typical 
office and support spaces for researchers; no lab space is included nor space planning 
parameters due to varied nature of research activities of these three components. 
Planners must use these spaces as the starting point in the planning process of these 
three R&D components and define final quantity and mix as well as any additional 
spaces on a project-by-project basis. Space for the Non-Profit Program is provided 
following the 30 BLR&D ranges in Small, Medium, and Large requirements each 
corresponding to 10 ranges. 
E. The SPCM includes 189 rooms organized in 17 Functional Areas, each room is assigned a 
Room Name, Room Code, baseline NSF/NSM and a resulting quantity and NSF value for 
each range. The VA278 Functional Areas: 
1. R&D Reception Area 
2. BLR&D Service Research Area 
3. BLR&D Service Support Area 
4. BLR&D Service Staff Area 
5. RR&D Service Staff Area 
6. CSR&D Service Staff Area 
7. HSR&D Service Staff Area 
8. VMU Treatment Area 
9. VMU Surgery Area 
10. VMU Imaging / Behavioral Study Area 
11. VMU Animal Area 
12. VMU Cagewash Area 
13. VMU Support Area 
14. VMU Staff Area 
15. R&D Non-Profit (N-P) Staff Area 
16. R&D Staff and Administrative Area 
17. R&D Support Area 
F. Section 4: Input Data Statements and Section 5: Space Planning Criteria in this 
document reflect the range values and ratios in the SPCM; these sections have been 
implemented in the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) software. Planners 
developing R&D projects must access these criteria in SEPS to generate a Program for 
Design (PFD) -the space program- for their project (s). 
G. Based on its intended function, each room / space in a PG-18-9 is assigned a: 
1. Room Name (RN), 
2. Room Code (RC), 
3. Room Area, the Net Square Feet (NSF) and its corresponding “soft metric” Net 
Square Meters (NSM), 
4. Room Criteria Statement(s) (RCS(s)) based on the SPCM range values correlated to 
answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) and SEPS Importer Shortcuts (at end of 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  June 1, 2022 
278 – Research and Development (R&D) 
8 of 52 
Section 4); a RCS defines a room condition to calculate the resulting NSF assigned to 
the room, and 
5. Room Comment if needed. 
The Room Name, Room Code, and Room Comment (when available) as well as the 
Functional Area Names are transferred verbatim to a project Program for Design (PFD); the 
resulting NSF is generated by computation of the Room Criteria Statement (RCS) 
parameters based on response(s) to the Input Data Statements (IDSs) during creation of a 
SEPS project. 
H. A baseline space program, a PFD, is generated as a result of Planner’s answers to Input 
Data Statements (IDSs) (Section 4). A Project Room Contents (PRC) Report which 
includes furniture, equipment and fixtures assigned to each Room Code can also be 
generated in SEPS, Room Contents are defined in PG-18-5. 
I. Determination of the number and area of the Reception and Support rooms is based on 
assigned ratios to the research areas defined in the SPCM for each Range. 
J. The Room Codes included in this chapter come from the VA Room Family (VARF) 
definition which are applicable to all PG-18-9 chapters. Based on function, rooms belong 
to the Patient Care Support (PCS) category. In addition to the “R&D” Room Family, 
rooms included in this document belong to the following families: “Bldg Sprt”, “Clncl 
Sprt”, “Educ Svc”, “Lgstcs Svc”, “OIT”, Police Svc”, and “Stff Sprt” 
K. Section 5, sub-section Q lists the SEPS Importer Shortcuts used in Section. These 
shortcuts are inserted into the Room Criteria Statement (RCS) for each room; shortcuts 
correspond to Input Data Statements in Section 4. SEPS uses them to determine the 
space requirements for a project based on answers to the Input Data Statements 
provided by planners. 
L. Refer to PG-18-5: Research and Development Equipment Guidelist for the Room 
Content assignment for each room included in this document. 
M. Refer to PG-18-12: Research and Development Design Guide for additional planning and 
design information and Room Guideplates/Templates for selected R&D rooms in this 
document. 
N. SEPS is accessible to government planners and private sector consultants working on VA 
projects during their Period of Performance (PoP) through the MAX.gov website. 
O. The Research and Development Department Net to Gross (DNTG) factor is 1.30; this 
value is multiplied by the total programmed net square feet (NSF) area to determine the 
departmental gross square feet (DGSF); the DNTG factor can not be changed. The 
Building Gross area is calculated, in SEPS, by applying the default 1.35 factor, planners 
can adjust this value.

6. PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. BIOMEDICAL LABORATORY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (BLR&D) SERVICE 
1. The primary design consideration for laboratory spaces is the safe use of hazardous 
materials such as chemicals, biological agents, radioisotopes, cryogenics, and 
hazardous gases. Consideration must include location and types of primary 
containment devices such as fume hoods and biological safety cabinets, storage 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  June 1, 2022 
278 – Research and Development (R&D) 
46 of 52 
cabinets, pathways of material inflow and hazardous waste outflow and space 
separation requirements. 
2. It is important to plan pathways for safe exiting of laboratory space to provide two 
exits from the lab where required by size or configuration of space. Space for any 
protocols required at exiting such as handwashing and lab coat removal must be 
planned. 
3. Flexibility for adaptive use of space and research needs change over time is an 
important consideration. The trend is to reduce fixed elements, where reasonable, 
and to minimize fixed elements that are difficult to move such as plumbing drains in 
the center of rooms. Place them on the perimeter where possible.  
4. In the laboratory space consider both the wet bench within the laboratory for 
experimental processes and procedures and dry bench within the lab for analytical 
work and results write-up. 
5. An increasingly important consideration is the increased use of cell and tissue 
culture. For example, culture needs might include clean culture for mammalian cells, 
3D cultures and organoids; bacterial culture to express proteins; and potentially 
hazardous culture for infectious disease and viral vectors. These different culture 
models may require separate spaces to avoid cross contamination. Design of a tissue 
culture room must allow a clear workflow to minimize the potential for culture 
contamination. 
6. With the increase in tissue culture needs comes the increase in the need for storage 
of cells in ultra-low temperature freezers and the related storage for growth media, 
supplies, and protective equipment. Ultra-low temperature freezers are large, and 
temperatures may be attained with mechanical equipment or liquid nitrogen. 
Mechanical freezers produce heat and noise. Locating them in a space with low 
occupancy and adequate cooling is critical. Liquid nitrogen freezers require liquid 
nitrogen to be moved into the space to fill the freezers. 
7. Considerations for fume hood rooms include placement of fume hoods to allow 
exiting from the space in the event of an accident, appropriate storage for chemicals 
used and bench space for weighing and measuring chemicals. 
8. Considerations for microscopy rooms include the ability to darken the space as well 
as low vibration structure and / or vibration isolation tables for the microscope. 
9. Consideration for the glassware washing room include the movement of carts into 
and out of the room and the movement and storage space for autoclave and 
glassware loading carts. 
10. Larger research centers labs may have shared facilities with specialized equipment 
for genomics, proteomics, mass spectroscopy and other technologies that require 
ganging smaller rooms together or accommodating technologies in open laboratory 
areas. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  June 1, 2022 
278 – Research and Development (R&D) 
47 of 52 
11. In the office areas outside of the laboratory provide dry work area analytical and 
other desk work. This space is becoming more important as bioinformatics becomes 
an increasingly prevalent aspect of research. 
B. REHABILITATION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (RR&D) SERVICE 
1. Some RR&D may have similar laboratory and VMU research requirements as found 
in BLR&D, however, animal model species may vary depending on areas of research. 
2. Rehabilitation research also involves significant engineering components that may 
require dry engineering laboratory space and fabrication space to develop and 
assemble devices including electronic and computer components. This may include 
robotics, bionics, advanced orthotics and prosthetics as sensors and assistive devises 
are integrated with the human body.  
3. Rehabilitation research often uses humans as research subject evaluating new 
therapies and technologies for safety and effectiveness. Similar design 
considerations as described for CSR&D may apply to the spaces where work is done 
with human subjects and in the dry workplace that supports the clinical research 
work.  
4. Rehabilitation research areas for physical and occupational therapy research 
generally requires large open areas to allow research subjects to move with assistive 
devices or on therapy equipment. This may involve creating videos of research 
activities.  
5. Rehabilitation research areas for cognitive issues require smaller spaces and quieter 
environments for one-on-one activities.  
6. Rehabilitation clinical research often involves persons in wheelchairs or with other 
forms of limited mobility. Adequate space for ramps and wheelchair access to 
rehabilitation equipment must be integral to the planning. 
7. Rehabilitation technologies are expanding rapidly, providing adequate space for 
research expansion must be a consideration in the early planning process. 
C. CLINICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (CSR&D) SERVICE 
1. CSR&D utilizes humans as research subjects. All human research subjects in the US 
are volunteers so design considerations that make research visible to Veterans 
visiting VA facilities can support awareness of VA research to potential volunteers.   
2. Create facility plans that allow easy access for research participants.  
3. Clinical research is both done in separate research clinics as well as integrated into 
standard of care clinics. Integration with standard-of-care requires providing enough 
clinical space and support to accommodate both the clinical visits and research 
visits. Research could be conducted in any type of clinical space.  
4. Provide space to allow accrual of volunteers into research projects or clinical trials 
and for the patient and family to give informed consent for participation.  
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  June 1, 2022 
278 – Research and Development (R&D) 
48 of 52 
5. Provide space for sample collection and initial processing to stabilize samples prior 
to moving to research laboratories. Assess where and how samples will be stored for 
research projects.  
6. Provide pharmacy space for experimental therapeutics.  
7. Workplace inside the clinical areas is required for investigators, research 
coordinators and research nurses. This may be touchdown space for work involving 
contact with research subjects if primary workplace is provided elsewhere.  
8. Separate dry workplace outside of the clinical areas is often required for 
investigators, research managers, research coordinators and other team members 
such as data analysts. As team members may need to contact research participants 
by phone, noise levels and patient privacy issues must be considered.   
9. Secure storage is critical in clinical research. Evaluation of size and location of 
storage is an important consideration. 
10. Many research records are required to be in hard copy. Both lockable short-term 
binder storage and long-term record storage must be evaluated.  
11. Training and education space must be considered to support research team 
development. 
12. Data analysis and artificial intelligence driven tools are increasingly important in 
clinical research. The ability to work with, visualize and share data with the most 
effective current tools and technologies are important design considerations. 
D.  HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (HSR&D) SERVICE 
1. HSR&D is primarily an office-based research activity. The workplace considerations 
from CSR&D and BLR&D must be evaluated for HSR&D as well.  
2. Data analysis is becoming an increasingly important activity in HSR&D. The ability to 
visualize and share data with the most effective tools is an important design 
consideration.  
3. The need for teams to be mobile for work in the field or collect data at other 
locations is increasing. Touchdown and collaborative work areas to provide a home 
base for these personnel in HSR&D workplaces must be evaluated.  
4. Training space for research teams must be a strong consideration. 
E. VETERINARY MEDICAL UNIT (VMU) 
1. Animal welfare is the prime design consideration for Veterinary Medical Units. 
Providing an environment for the appropriate housing and care of the animals is 
critical including temperature and lighting. 
2. Safety for personnel is an important consideration. VMUs can be wet environments 
where large, heavy cage racks are moved. Slip resistant flooring, wall protection, 
wide corridors and door openings are all requirements to allow safe and efficient 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  June 1, 2022 
278 – Research and Development (R&D) 
49 of 52 
movement. Cage changing stations to reduce dander in the environment is an 
important consideration for staff safety. 
3. Durability and protection of finishes, door frames wall mounter equipment is critical 
as large heavy equipment is moved through the facility. Damaged finished and other 
defects can be identified by laboratory animal accrediting agencies. 
4. Designing to reduce areas for vermin harborage is a significant consideration. Crack 
and crevices must be eliminated or minimized. Unnecessary floor mounter cabinets 
must be avoided. 
5. Cage and rack washing space must be planned to allow the easy movement of large 
cage racks. The layout on the dirty side must follow the process for cage dumping, 
disassembly and placement of cages and parts in the washing equipment. Once the 
cages are washed the design must support the flow of cage reassembly, filling with 
bedding, food and other materials and placement on racks for distribution to holding 
rooms in the facility. 
6. Animal species to be housed will be a driver of room and specific housing. 
Considerations that may impact planning will be specific research study 
requirements such as behavioral studies, infectious disease research, and other 
specialized studies. 
7. Operating suites for larger animals such as rabbits, swine and sheep must be 
planned to accommodate a wide range of procedures and survival surgeries. 
Procedure space for rodents must be provided to allow research teams to handle 
animals separately for research procedures from the care teams changing cages in 
cage change stations within the room. 
8. Imaging suites must be designed for future equipment flexibility as small animal 
imaging technology is evolving and equipment will change over time. Small animal 
PET scanner studies will require handling and disposal of radioisotopes. 
9. The staff breakroom and office area must have natural light if possible as little other 
natural light is found in animal facilities.

1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines Space Planning Criteria for Chapter 279: Police Service. It applies to 
all medical facilities at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
These criteria support the functions of the service including implementation of policies and 
law enforcement operations for the protection of patients, visitors, and employees, and the 
protection of property and the maintenance of law and order on property under the charge 
and control of the Veterans Health Administration. 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Police Service: Formerly Police and Security Service, implements policies and procedures 
related to facility security and law enforcement operations. Functions of the service include 
the protection of patients, visitors, and employees. It also includes the protection of 
property and the maintenance of law and order on property under the charge and control 
of the Veterans Health Administration. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the

item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature.

Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project.

SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Police Service 
Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as a basis for this chapter. The SPCM 
lists all the spaces a VA Police Service site would require; the quantity and NSF for each 
room is calculated based on number of Police Officer and Detective FTE positions 
authorized organized in three ranges each corresponding to three FTE positions 
authorized incrementally. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
279 – Police Service 
5 of 10 
B. The room quantity (Q) and area (NSF) values included for each range in the SPCM are 
reflected in the Room Criteria Statements, placed immediately below each room name, 
room code and NSF/NSM, for each room in Section 5 of this document. The number of 
Police Service FTE positions authorized is included in the Input Data Statements (IDSs) in 
Section 4. Both Sections are implemented in the Space Planning and Equipment System 
(SEPS) software accessible through the MAX.gov website. Planners programming a VA 
Police Service project shall develop a baseline Program for Design (PFD) in SEPS. 
C. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross (NTDG) factor of 1.30 for Police Service 
and a Building Gross (BG) factor of 1.35 in the space calculation. These factors generate 
the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross Square Feet (BGSF) for 
the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet (NSF) for all Departments 
included. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the NTDG factor is fixed. 
D. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website. Space planning criteria 
have been developed on the basis of an understanding of the activities involved in the 
functional areas of the Police Service and its relationship with other services of a 
medical facility. These criteria are predicated on established and/or anticipated best 
practice standards, as adapted to provide environments supporting the highest quality 
health care for Veterans.

Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality.

3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Service 
Organizations Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as a basis for this 
chapter. The SPCM lists all the spaces a VA Service Organizations site would require; the 
quantity and NSF for each room is calculated based on number of National Service 
Organizations authorized for the facility organized in ten ranges each corresponding to 
one National Organization authorized incrementally. 
B. The room quantity (Q) and area (NSF) values included for each range in the SPCM are 
reflected in the Room Criteria Statements, placed immediately below each room name, 
room code and NSF/NSM, for each room in Section 5 of this document. The number of 
National Organizations is included in the Input Data Statements (IDSs) in Section 4. Both 
Sections are implemented in the Space Planning and Equipment System (SEPS) software 
accessible through the MAX.gov website. Planners programming a VA Service 
Organizations project shall develop a baseline Program for Design (PFD) in SEPS. 
C. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross (NTDG) factor of 1.20 for Service 
Organizations and a Building Gross (BG) factor of 1.35 in the space calculation. These 
factors generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross 
Square Feet (BGSF) for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet 
(NSF) for all Departments included. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the 
NTDG factor is fixed.

1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines Space Planning Criteria for Chapter 282: Social Work Service. It 
applies to all medical facilities at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
Social Work Service is responsible to assist patients and families maintain psychosocial wellbeing
by resolving existing barriers and creating connections to solutions. Aspects of 
services include assessment, treatment planning, case management, coordination of VA and 
community services, psychosocial treatment, individual, marital and group counseling, 
discharge planning, community-based care planning, patient education and financial and 
vocational planning. 
Social Work Services are provided across the entire VHA continuum of care including special 
emphasis programs serving the homeless, the seriously mentally ill, spinal cord injured, 
women, poly-trauma patients, and others. 
VHA Social Work provides clinical training to over 600 MSW students annually. 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
282 – Social Work Service 
3 of 9 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning system (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
282 – Social Work Service 
4 of 9 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality.

2 DEFINITIONS 
Automated Transport: A computer-controlled materials handling system that moves carts 
along pre-programmed paths to deliver goods. Also referred to as an Automated Guided 
Vehicle System (AGVS). 
Bulk Item Storage: High-bay storage of supplies that are purchased in large quantities, 
including full pallets, and case-lots. If not available for purchase in a more convenient 
format, bulk supplies may be broken down into packages or low unit of measure before 
being transferred to Unit Item Storage. Bulk item storage may also accommodate pandemic 
supplies, disaster preparedness supplies, and similar items not typically required to 
maintain routine operation of the medical center. 
Clean Linen Storage: An area where clean linen is stored for issue. Clean linen distribution 
may be the responsibility of either Logistics or Environmental Programs Service (EPS) at the 
discretion of the particular medical facility. 
Clean Loading Dock: Accommodates the delivery of clean material and equipment. 
Separation between clean and soiled loading docks must be maintained. 
Exchange Cart Replenishment: A system where patient care areas are restocked with 
supplies, or clean linens, based on predetermined schedules. While one exchange cart is in 
use within a patient area, another is being restocked in Logistics or EPS as a replacement. 
Flex Storage: Temporary holding space for incoming supplies and equipment that are not 
ready for delivery or installation. These items include beds, stretchers, computer 
equipment, furnishings, and construction materials. 
Logical Unit of Measure (LUM): A supply delivery model, also referred to as Low Unit of 
Measure, whereby medical products that are ordered, received, and replenished directly to 
end users in a ready-to-use format. This model is part of a “just in time” vendor supported 
replenishment system. 
Logistics Receiving, Storage and Dispatch: An area where the receipt and storage of clean 
supplies, sterile supplies, and sterile instruments takes place in a controlled environment 
prior to distributing these items to end users. 
Pandemic Storage: A portion of the medical center’s disaster preparedness provisions that 
would complement the Pharmacy Cache with non-prescription related medical supplies.

Items may vary by region / VISN or by medical center, but would typically include storage of 
needles & syringes, masks, gloves and assorted personal protective equipment (PPE). 
Receiving / Processing: An area within Logistics, where the detailed inspection of material 
and equipment occurs. In this area, Logistics staff will complete the appropriate receiving 
reports, and the sorting of all items for delivery to the appropriate storage location. Boxes 
and packing material are broken down into smaller quantities for placement on shelves or 
delivery to end users. 
Service Yard: An exterior area, with controlled access, adjacent to the Loading Dock(s) used 
for maneuvering and temporary parking of service and delivery vehicles. 
Soiled Loading Dock: Accommodates one or more truck bays for the interface with trash 
compactors, recycling compactors / dumpsters, on-site treatment of regulated medical 
waste (if authorized), and the removal of soiled linen, sharps, and other soiled materials. 
The Soiled Loading Dock may be located adjacent to, but must be physically separated from, 
the Clean Loading Docks. 
Standard Storage Unit: Used as a metric for planning SPS and Unit Item storage 
requirements, using modules representing typical open wire shelves with dimensions of 24” 
D x 60” W x 72” H. It is also applicable for planning other storage requirements in areas such 
as the surgical suite / clean core. 
Truck Bay: A space at the loading dock that accommodates one delivery truck. Loading 
docks are comprised of multiple truck bays to accommodate deliveries and may incorporate 
dock lifts and leveling devices. 
Unit Item Storage: Accommodates the storage of medical and non-medical supplies that are 
dispensed in less than case-lot quantities, including logical (low) unit of measure. Also 
known as Clean Unit Storage. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022

assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning system (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022

/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022

6 of 20 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Logistics 
Service Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as a basis for this chapter. The 
SPCM lists all the spaces a VA Logistics Service site would require; the quantity and NSF 
for each room is calculated based on the number of patient beds, exam /procedure 
rooms (all types), Operating Rooms (ORs) (all types) organized in five ranges each 
incrementally. 
B. The room quantity (Q) and area (NSF) values included for each range in the SPCM are 
reflected in the Room Criteria Statements, placed immediately below each room name, 
room code and NSF/NSM, for each room in Section 5 of this document. The number of 
Logistics Service Patient Beds, Exam / Procedure Rooms and Operating Rooms is 
included in the Input Data Statements (IDSs) in Section 4. Both Sections are 
implemented in the Space Planning and Equipment System (SEPS) software accessible 
through the MAX.gov website. Planners programming a VA Logistics Service project shall 
develop a baseline Program for Design (PFD) in SEPS. 
C. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross (NTDG) factor of 1.10 for Logistics Service 
and a Building Gross (BG) factor of 1.35 in the space calculation. These factors generate 
the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross Square Feet (BGSF) for 
the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet (NSF) for all Departments 
included. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the NTDG factor is fixed. 
D. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website.

2 of 17 
1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines space planning criteria for services and programs provided in VA 
Chapter 285: Sterile Processing Service for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). It 
applies to all medical facilities at the VA. 
Policies and directives, VA Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), and established and / or 
anticipated best practice guidelines / standards provides the foundation for the workload 
based space criteria and Net Square Footages (NSF) for each space. 
2 DEFINITIONS 
AAMI: In conjunction with ANSI, The Association for the Advancement of Medical 
Instrumentation (AMMI) is the source for all practice and design standards for 
decontamination, disinfection, and sterilization. 
ANSI: Supporting the development and approval of national voluntary standards, the 
American National Standards Institute (ANSI) develops accreditation programs and serves as 
the U.S. representative to the International Standards Organization (ISO). 
Automated Endoscopic Reprocessor (AER): A fully automated device for testing, cleaning 
and high-level disinfection of various types of flexible fiberoptic scopes. These devices are 
used to minimize hand washing and eliminate soaking scopes in toxic chemical agents. AERs 
can foster standardized scope processing and promote a consistent level of care. 
Biomedical Engineering: A support department that inspects, tests, repairs and maintains a 
wide range of patient care equipment. Biomedical Engineering may provide primary 
response for maintaining SPS equipment. It also works closely with Logistics for the 
temporary storage of new items before they are put into service, and for existing items 
awaiting repair or parts. Biomedical Engineering may also be called Clinical Engineering. 
Case Cart: A physical cart, but also a supply concept, whereby most supplies and 
instruments needed for a surgical procedure are pre-assembled, and placed into a (case) 
cart. The case cart is designated for a specific procedure, a specific surgeon, and a specific 
patient that is scheduled for an assigned time and location (procedure room). Case carts are 
typically pre-assembled the day before a scheduled case, but can also be assembled as 
needed / “just-in-time”. 
Container Rack: A specialty cart used in conjunction with an automatic cart washer, which 
accommodates rigid instrument containers and tops for cleaning and disinfection. 
Decontamination - Soiled Work: Includes the receipt, cleaning and disinfection of surgical 
instruments, scopes, patient care equipment, reusable medical devices, carts and related 
patient care items. 
Infection Control Risk Assessment (ICRA): A multidisciplinary, organizational, documented 
process that considers the medical facility’s patient population and mission to reduce the 
risk of infection based on knowledge about infection, infectious agents, and the care 
environment, permitting the facility to anticipate potential impact. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
285 – Sterile Processing Service 
3 of 17 
Preparation and Assembly – Clean Work: Includes inspection, reassembly, functional testing 
and packaging of instruments, instrument sets, scopes, and related medical devices prior to 
terminal sterilization of these items. 
Receiving, Storage and Dispatch Area: Spaces to handle the receipt and storage of clean 
supplies, sterile supplies, and sterile instruments within a controlled environment prior to 
distributing these items to end users. 
Reverse Osmosis Deionized (RO / DI) Purified Water: Water suitable for sterile processing 
applications has specific resistivity of 0.1 megohm per cm. RO / DI purified water is required 
for the final rinse cycle of instrument washer-decontaminators, at the clean-up sinks, and is 
used in ultrasonic cleaners. 
Standard Storage Unit: Used as a metric for planning SPS and Unit Item storage 
requirements, using modules representing typical open wire shelves with dimensions of 24” 
D x 60” W x 72” H. It is also applicable for planning other storage requirements in areas such 
as the surgical suite / clean core. 
Sterile Processing Service (SPS): provides the cleaning disinfection and sterilization for 
surgical instruments, and various reusable medical devices and patient care equipment. SPS 
typically stores surgical supplies, instrumentation and related items for distribution to all 
clinical areas, from inpatient care units, Operating Rooms, and procedure rooms, to 
outpatient surgical units, clinics, and ED. 
Sterilization: The elimination of all living microorganisms. 
Transport Cart: A mobile cart used to transport instruments, scopes or supplies between 
sterile processing and patient care areas. Transfer carts may be used to deliver clean / 
sterile items from sterile processing to user areas, or to collect and return soiled items to 
sterile processing. A transport cart may also be referred to as a Transfer Cart. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
285 – Sterile Processing Service 
4 of 17 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning system (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
285 – Sterile Processing Service 
5 of 17 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022

departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Sterile 
Processing Service Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as a basis for this 
chapter. The SPCM lists all the spaces a VA Sterile Processing Service site would require; 
the quantity and NSF for each room is calculated based on the number of instrument 
sets, scopes, to be processed, processed per day, the number of Operating Rooms -all 
types- and the number of daily procedures projected in twenty ranges organized in four 
groups of five ranges each as follows: 
1. Instrument sets: 100 per range, total 500 
2. Scopes: 15 per range, total 75 
3. Operating Rooms (ORs) all types: 4 per range, total 20 
4. Daily procedures all types: 100 per range, total 500 
B. The room quantity (Q) and area (NSF) values included for each range in the SPCM are 
reflected in the Room Criteria Statements, placed immediately below each room name, 
room code and NSF/NSM, for each room in Section 5 of this document. The number of 
instrument sets and scopes to be processed daily, number of Operating Rooms (ORs) in 
the facility and number of daily procedures is included in the Input Data Statements 
(IDSs) in Section 4. Both Sections are implemented in the Space Planning and Equipment 
System (SEPS) software accessible through the MAX.gov website. Planners programming 
a VA Sterile Processing Service project shall develop a baseline Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
C. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross (NTDG) factor of 1.30 for Sterile 
Processing Service and a Building Gross (BG) factor of 1.35 in the space calculation. 
These factors generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building 
Gross Square Feet (BGSF) for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square 
Feet (NSF) for all Departments included. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the 
NTDG factor is fixed. 
D. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are available at 
the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) 
Technical Information Library (TIL) website.

6 PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. Plan SPS for flexibility and adaptability to accommodate future expansion, storage 
capacity and equipment / technology. To the extent possible, provide space and utilities 
for one additional instrument washer-decontaminator and one additional steam 
sterilizer. 
B. Special consideration should be given to planning external circulation patterns in order 
to control the flow of clean and soiled traffic in and around SPS. The internal workflow 
of SPS should be unidirectional so that soiled items flow progressively to the clean work 
areas of the department. Similarly, clean items should flow to sterilization, to storage, to 
case cart staging, and finally dispatch/issue. 
C. Consider security requirements early on in design. This would include controlled access 
points and entrances, and video monitoring in strategic locations. 
D. SPS design and location must provide the complete, physical separation of soiled 
materials and activities from clean activities associated with instrument assembly, 
preparation, sterilization, storage and dispatch. 
E. SPS may be located on the same level and contiguous to the Surgical Suite. Alternatively, 
the two departments are most often stacked vertically to facilitate direct connections 
with dedicated clean and soiled elevators. 
F. A single elevator cannot be used for both clean and soiled transport. Dumbwaiters may 
be an alternative to supplement elevators, or to move only instruments or supplies. Cart 
lifts or floor loading dumbwaiters are not recommended in new construction as they 
limit staff interaction and communication, which are requirements for both SPS and 
Surgery. 
G. Refer to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management Technical Information Library (www.cfm.va.gov/til/) for additional 
technical criteria.

1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines Space Planning Criteria for Surgical and Endovascular Services and it 
applies to all medical facilities at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). It also 
incorporates Cardiovascular Laboratories. Surgical / Endovascular Services are provided in 
Inpatient Surgical Facilities or Ambulatory Surgery Centers (ASCs) while Endovascular 
Services are provided in Inpatient Surgical Facilities only. 
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) assigned a complexity level to each of its 
inpatient and ambulatory surgical programs based on VHA Directive 2010-018 “Facility 
Infrastructure Requirements to Perform Standard, Intermediate, or Complex Surgical 
Procedures” and VHA Directive 2011-037 “Facility Infrastructure Requirements to Perform 
Invasive Procedures in an Ambulatory Surgery Center”. Surgical Procedures performed in an 
Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC) are assigned either a Basic or Advanced complexity level. 
This document incorporates these policies and sets forth Room Criteria Statements for each 
room / space in both Inpatient and Ambulatory Surgery facility types. I also incorporate 
OMB Memorandum M-12-12 “Promoting Efficient Spending to Support Agency Operations” 
and OMB Memorandum 2015-01 “Implementation of OMB Memorandum M-12-12” 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC): An ASC is a free standing VHA facility separate from an 
inpatient VHA Surgery Program. Outpatient (same day) surgery performed in a separate 
building on a VHA campus with an inpatient VHA Surgery Program would be considered an 
ASC if community paramedics are used to respond to emergencies according to current VHA 
policy on Out-of-Operating Room Airway Management. 
Ambulatory Surgery Program: An Ambulatory Surgery Program provides surgical procedures 
on an outpatient basis in an ASC; distinguishable from an inpatient VHA Surgery Program 
performing surgical procedures on a same-day or outpatient basis at a VA medical center. 
Anesthesia Procedure Room: A dedicated space for Anesthesia Providers to perform 
regional blocks or line placement prior to surgery. A patient would be transported to this 
area or room from the Pre-Op area or another area of the hospital if applicable. If this space 
is authorized, it should be near the ORs but observable by staff working at a nursing station. 
Anesthesia Workroom: Room with space for storing and maintaining anesthesia equipment 
and supplies. Includes a workstation for the anesthesia technician, space for work 
counter(s) and sink(s) and racks for cylinders.  
Biplane Hybrid OR: An operating room designed to accommodate use of a Biplane advanced 
imaging technology system. 
Biplane System: Advanced interventional imaging technology capable of shooting images 
along two axis or planes simultaneously. Used for a variety of cardiovascular and 
neurovascular image-guided interventional procedures. The biplane imaging system is 
physically large because it is made up of two x-ray systems, or two C-arms, as opposed to a 
monoplane system which has one C-arm. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA February 1, 2023 
286 – Surgical / Endovascular Services 
3 of 76 
Bariatric Surgery: Surgical procedures, generally performed on morbidly obese individuals, 
which cause weight loss by restricting the amount of food the stomach can hold, causing 
malabsorption of nutrients, or by a combination of both gastric restriction and 
malabsorption. Bariatric Surgery is a recognized subspecialty in the field of General Surgery. 
Cardiac Catheterization (Cardiac Cath.): A cardiac procedure where a thin plastic tube 
(catheter) is inserted into an artery or vein in the arm or leg. The catheter is then advanced 
into the chambers of the heart, or into the coronary arteries. This procedure is performed 
to obtain diagnostic information about the patient’s heart and blood vessels. It may also be 
used to provide therapeutic interventions in certain types of heart conditions. 
Cardiology: The study of the heart and its functions.
 
Case Cart(s): Case Cart(s) are used to bring sterile materials and instruments from Sterile 
Processing Service (SPS) to the Operating Room. A typical case cart contains specific items 
required for each surgical case, including all required instruments and other supplies. After 
the operation is completed, reusable items are reloaded onto the cart and sent back to SPS 
for decontamination, disposal, or reprocessing. Case carts are also supplied and kept in the 
surgery department for most frequently performed emergency cases. 
Cardiothoracic OR: An operating room designed to support Cardiac and Thoracic surgeries 
using special equipment and generally requiring a larger space. 
Clean Core: Operating rooms are grouped around a clean core. The Clean Core is used for 
sterile supply storage. This is the cleanest area of the entire Operating Suite. Only staff 
wearing appropriate surgical attire shall be permitted in the Clean Core. 
Complexity Level: See Surgical Complexity Level. 
Control Station: A space located to permit visual observation of all traffic which enters the 
operating suite. 
Endovascular Service Procedure Rooms: Endovascular service procedure rooms consist of 
individual procedures such as cardiac catheterization laboratories, electrophysiology 
laboratories, interventional radiology (IR) laboratories and vascular surgery laboratories. 
Endovascular service procedure rooms provide minimally invasive image-guided diagnosis 
and treatment of diseases in every organ system. The range of procedures performed in 
these rooms are broad, the unifying concept behind these procedures is the use of current 
accepted interventional medical practice to provide the least invasive technique available in 
order to minimize risk to the patient and improve health outcomes. 
Frozen Section Laboratory: This is the area for preparation and examination of frozen 
sections. The frozen section procedure is performed under a microscope by the surgical 
pathologist while surgery is taking place. Interpretation is rapid and results are 
communicated with the surgeon while surgery is taking place. 
Hybrid OR: An operating room which integrates the traditional surgical functions of the OR 
with advanced imaging technologies. This is the largest OR in size. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA February 1, 2023 
286 – Surgical / Endovascular Services 
4 of 76 
Immediate Use Sterilization: It is a process designed for the steam sterilization of patient 
care items for immediate use. Also known as “emergent sterilization” or “flash 
sterilization”. An example would be a dropped instrument. Sterilizers for flash sterilization 
should be located as close as possible to the Operating Rooms, preferably in a shared space 
adjacent to the Operating Rooms with immediate access from the semi-restricted corridor 
for service. 
Inpatient Surgical / Endovascular Services: Inpatient surgical and endovascular services is an 
integrated interventional platform which provides both surgical and endovascular services 
on either a single or vertically stacked platform (floor plate) consisting of dedicated 
interventional radiology, interventional cardiology (catheterization), electrophysiology and 
neurointerventional services including standard and complex Surgical / Endovascular 
Services. The operating rooms are larger and can accommodate more specialized 
equipment and technology, including intraoperative imaging, microsurgery, and robotics. A 
special hybrid suite includes imaging capability, meaning, for example, that an angiogram 
can be performed during an operation without requiring movement of the patient to 
another location. 
Integrated Surgical Platform: Surgical / Endovascular Services which are co-located with 
interventional cardiac and/or interventional radiology services. The surgical operating 
rooms, cardiac catheterization / procedure laboratories, and interventional radiology 
procedure rooms are located proximate to one another allowing joint use of perioperative 
nursing support services (preoperative and postoperative recovery nursing services) for 
multiple departments. In new construction, the ideal layout locates surgical operating 
rooms and interventional procedure rooms behind the red line of the semi-restricted area 
in the Surgical / Endovascular Services Department. A renovation project may be unable to 
expand the existing semi-restricted area to accommodate additional interventional rooms, 
but may be able to achieve horizontal or vertical adjacencies of the interventional 
procedure rooms with the Surgical / Endovascular Services department to facilitate joint use 
of perioperative nursing support services. 
Interventional Radiology (IR): also known as vascular and interventional radiology (VIR) or 
surgical radiology, is a medical sub-specialty of radiology providing minimally-invasive 
image-guided procedures to diagnose and treat diseases in nearly every organ system. The 
concept behind interventional radiology is to diagnose and treat patients using the least 
invasive techniques currently available in order to minimize risk to the patient and improve 
health outcomes. These procedures have less risk, less pain, and less recovery time in 
comparison to open surgery. The IR Suite utilizes the same imaging modality type as in a 
catheterization-EP Lab and/or hybrid OR, clinical staffing is different. 
Invasive Cardiology: Procedures that include all invasive cardiac related services such as 
Cardiac Cath., Therapeutic Cardiovascular Procedures, Electrophysiology (EP) and 
Pacemaker Implantation. 
Monoplane Hybrid OR: An operating room designed to accommodate use of a Monoplane 
advanced imaging technology system. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA February 1, 2023 
286 – Surgical / Endovascular Services 
5 of 76 
Monoplane System: Advanced interventional imaging technology which produces images 
along one axis or plane at a time. Multiple axis or plane images can only be produced by 
shooting images subsequently. 
Neurosurgical OR: An operating room designed to support Neurosurgical surgeries using 
special equipment and generally requiring a larger space. 
Operating Room (OR): A room designed and equipped to perform a wide variety of surgical 
procedures involving the administration of anesthesia. 
Orthopedic OR: An operating room designed to support orthopedic surgeries using special 
equipment and generally requiring a larger space. 
Phase II Recovery: The patient is transitioned from Phase I recovery to Phase II recovery 
when intensive nursing care is no longer needed, and the patient becomes more alert and 
functional. Phase II allows preparations to be made to progress the patient towards 
discharge to home. 
Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) Viewing Room: A digital radiology 
reading room that consists of workstations for interpretation. 
Pre-Operative Holding / Phase II Recovery: This is where the majority of surgical patients are 
prepared for their surgical procedures under the care of a nurse. In this area, the patient 
changes into a gown, a nursing assessment is performed, and teaching is provided. 
Belongings will be secured, and an Intravenous line may be started. An Anesthesiologist will 
interview the patient here and may give intravenous sedation. Patient will be transported 
from this area to the OR. 
Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) / Phase I Recovery: Patient cubicle area f
or the recovery 
of patients after surgical procedures. PACU/ Phase I Recovery is an area dedicated to 
receive patients following general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or monitored anesthesia 
care. Phase I requires close monitoring, including airway, ventilator, and hemodynamic 
support. Patients are generally accommodated in a stretcher bay or cubicle. 
Robotics Surgery: A method to perform surgery using very small tools attached to a robotic 
arm controlled by the surgeon via computer. 
Robotics OR: An operating room with appropriate infrastructure support to accommodate 
use of robotics equipment during a surgical procedure. 
Scrubs Distribution Alcove: This is a room or area to dispense and receive scrubs. Space may 
be provided within the locker rooms or directly adjacent to them. This may include an 
automated scrub management system / automated dispensing and receiving machine. 
Scrub Sink Area: A space with at least one scrub position. A scrub position is equipped with 
a hands-free fixture to enable medical personnel to scrub their hands prior / after 
performing a surgical procedure; the hot / cold mixing valve is activated via a knee or foot 
control.

6 of 76 
Surgical Complexity Level: Based on recommendation of the Operative Complexity and 
Infrastructure Workgroup VHA established the Procedure Infrastructure Matrix (PIM) and 
the Operative Complexity Matrix (OCM). A VHA facility with an Inpatient Surgical Program 
shall be designated as Standard, Intermediate or Complex while a VHA facility with an 
Ambulatory Surgery Program shall be designated as Basic or Advanced. The PIM documents 
the infrastructure requirements each facility type and the OCM establishes a complexity 
assignment to all surgical procedures by Current Procedure Terminology (CPT) code. 
Surgical Suite: The surgical suite is a group of rooms designed to provide all surgical and 
endovascular services to patients. Includes surgical and endovascular procedure rooms, 
preparation and anesthesia for the patient, sterile preparation of the surgeon and surgical / 
interventional team members, equipment storage, post anesthesia care unit, phase II 
recovery rooms, satellite pharmacy, frozen section laboratory, staff changing-toilets and 
lounge including family waiting and consultation areas, and in general, encompasses all 
areas. 
Surgical / Endovascular 
Services: Surgical Service / Endovascular, in this document, 
incorporates Inpatient Surgical / Endovascular Services and Ambulatory Surgical Center. 
Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE): A diagnostic echocardiogram test which is done 
through the esophagus and employs ultrasound waves to make images of the heart 
chambers, valves, and surrounding structures. The esophagus is located directly behind the 
heart, and images from a TEE test can give very clear pictures of the heart and its structure. 
Transplant OR: An operating room designed to support harvesting of body organs and 
tissues from one patient (donor), and transplantation of such organs and tissues into 
another patient (recipient.) Two OR’s are programmed allowing immediate transport from 
the donor to the recipient. 
Urology / Cystoscopy OR: An operating room designed to support Urology and Cystoscopy 
surgeries using special equipment and generally requiring a larger space. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Accessible: A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with provisions outlined 
in the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA). 
Architectural Barriers Act (ABA): A set of standards developed to ensure that all buildings 
financed with federal funds are designed and constructed to be fully accessible to everyone. 
This law requires all construction, renovation, or leasing of sites, facilities, buildings, and 
other elements, financed with federal funds, to comply with the Architectural Barriers Act 
Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). The ABAAS replaces the Uniform Federal Accessibility 
Standards (UFAS). 
Average Length of Encounter (ALoE): Averaged length of time, in minutes, a patient spends 
in an Exam / Treatment Room interacting with a provider and the clinical support team. It is 
accounted from room “set-up” to “clean-up” by staff. This metric is used to determine the 
number of annual patient / provider encounters that take place in an Exam / Treatment 
Room which, in turn, is used to calculate the number of Exam / Treatment Rooms needed in 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA February 1, 2023 
286 – Surgical / Endovascular Services 
7 of 76 
a facility based on projected annual workload. The ALoE is determined with VHA SME input 
during a PG-18-9 clinical chapter revision / update. 
Average Length of Stay (ALoS): The average number of days a patient Veteran stays in an 
inpatient care unit. The ALoS is used to calculate the number of patient bedrooms for a 
specialty by dividing the site’s projected workload by the ALoS. 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Clinic Stop: Per these criteria, a clinic stop is the workload u
nit of measure for space 
planning. Clinic Stops are codified by VSSC, when applicable, they are referenced by number 
in the calculation of workload driven patient care spaces in this document. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Encounter: An interaction between a patie
nt Veteran and a VA provider or providers in an 
Exam Room / Treatment Room / Consultation Room / Procedure Room, spaces where a 
patient Veteran received clinical care. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE)
: A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS).

JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Patient Unique: (or Unique Patient), A Veteran patient counted as a unique in each division 
from which they receive care. Patient Uniques are included in the Registry for a VA Medical 
Center. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements, and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Provider: An individual who ex
amines, diagnoses, treats, prescribes medication, and 
manages the care of patients within his or her scope of practice as established by the 
governing body of a healthcare organization. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non
-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC)
: A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table

9 of 76 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
Room Efficiency Factor: A factor that provides flexibility in the utilization of a room to 
account for patient delays, scheduling conflicts, and equipment maintenance. Common 
factors are in the 75% to 85% range. A room with 80% room efficiency provides a buffer to 
assume that this room would be available 20% of the time beyond the planned operational 
practices for this room. This factor may be adjusted based on the actual and/or anticipated 
operations and processes of the room/department at a particular facility. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
Stop Code: A measure of workload including clinic stops forecasted by the Office of Policy 
and Planning (OPP) for all Strategic Planning Categories at Medical Center and Outpatient 
Clinic levels. 
Technical Information Library (TIL): The Office of Construction & Facilities Management 
(CFM) provides support for all major construction and lease projects. The TIL contains 
design and construction standards for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The TIL is aimed 
at VA employees in medical centers, community based clinics, regional offices, and national 
cemeteries as well as A/E consultants and provides relevant technical information for 
project development. Department of Veterans Affairs Technical Information Library (VA 
TIL). 
Telehealth: The use of technology, such as computers and mobile devices, to manage 
healthcare remotely. It includes a variety of health care services, including but not limited to 
online support groups, online health information and self-management tools, email and 
online communication with health care providers, remote monitoring of vital signs, video, 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA February 1, 2023

10 of 76 
or online doctor visits. Depending on the concept of operations for this space, it may be 
equipped as an exam room or as a consult room with video/camera capability. 
Utilization Rate: A factor used in the calculation of a directly workload-driven room 
throughput. It represents, in a percent value, the room is idle based on the planning 
assumptions. For example, if a directly workload-driven room is available for use 8 hours a 
day, the Utilization Rate represents the assumed time it will be used, an 85% utilization rate 
indicates, for planning purposes, the room will be used 6.8 hours a day. An additional 
directly workload-driven room will be provided in the calculation once the previous room 
has reached 100% utilization. The utilization Rate is embedded in the Room Throughput 
value calculated in Section 3 of this document. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
Workstation: Area outfitted with equipment and furnishings, typically allocated 56 NSF 
each. Managers and other staff with no direct reports as well as part-time, seasonal, and 
job-sharing staff may qualify for a workstation. Such environments are particularly 
conducive to team-oriented office groupings. These environments work best when they 
have access to conference and small group meeting spaces. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space planning criteria included in this Standard have been specifically developed for 
this Department / Service in a Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare facility based 
on established VHA policy and guidelines to define the scope of services provided for 
the existing workload demand as well as that in the foreseeable future. Rooms and 
Functional Areas are provided based on research of clinical and non-clinical activities 
performed in this Department.

11 of 76 
B. Development / update of VA’s Program Guide (PG) standards is a research based effort 
executed with participation of VHA Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), VA-Construction and 
Facilities Management Office (CFM) professional staff and specialty consultants hired for 
the task. These space planning standards are based on current applicable VHA policies 
and guidelines, established and/or anticipated best practice standards, and latest 
medical technology developments. Workload metrics were tailored to satisfy current 
and anticipated veteran workload demand. 
C. The space planning component of PG-18-9 is based on the Space Planning Concept 
Matrix (SPCM) which lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and assigns room 
quantity (Q) and area (NSF) for a series of ranges corresponding to the smallest to the 
largest department for this service in the VA healthcare system in incremental size; each 
range corresponds to a workload parameter which determines the number and area of 
each directly workload-driven room. The remainder of the rooms in the range i.e., 
waiting, storage, staff workstations, etc. are determined by ratios to the resulting 
number of or NSF of the workload-driven rooms. 
D. Sections 4 and 5 of these space planning standards as well as the PG-18-5 standard are 
implemented in the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) and hosted at the 
MAX.gov website so planners working on VA Construction projects can develop single or 
multi-department projects based on these PG-18-9- and the PG-18-5 standards. Output 
from SEPS is through Space and Contents Reports; the Space Report is the Program for 
Design (PFD), the Content Report is the Project Room Contents (PRC). Inclusion of a 
Functional Area as well as Room quantity (Q) and determination of the room area (NSF) 
in the PFD is based on the projected Workload input which triggers calculations included 
in the Room Criteria Statements (RCSs). The RCSs are placed immediately after each 
room name, room code and baseline area (NSF). The PRC list the medical equipment, 
furniture and fixtures associated to each Room Code in the project. The PFD & PRC are 
the baseline requirements for the planning phase of a VA project based on a site’s 
projected workload for the target planning year. This chapter’s corresponding PG-18-12, 
Design Guide -if available- is intended for use during the design phase of the project. 
E. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Surgical / 
Endovascular Services Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as the basis for 
this chapter. The Surgical / Endovascular Services SPCM lists all the spaces a VA 
Inpatient Surgical / Endovascular Services or an Ambulatory Surgical Center site would 
require; the quantity and NSF for each room is calculated based on the number of 
Operating Rooms (ORs) authorized and the Surgical Complexity assigned to a VA 
inpatient or ambulatory site as follows: 
1. Inpatient Standard Surgical Complexity: five ranges: 
a. 2 to 4 General ORs, and 
b. 1 Urology/Cystoscopy OR 
2. Inpatient Intermediate Surgical Complexity: twenty-one ranges: 
a. 2 to 4 General ORs, 
b. 1 or 2 Urology/Cystoscopy ORs, 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA February 1, 2023

c. 2 Orthopedic ORs,  
d. 2 Cardiovascular ORs, 
e. 1 Robotics OR, 
f. 1 Transplant OR, 
g. 2 Hybrid Monoplane ORs, 
h. 2 Hybrid Biplane ORs, 
i. 1 Hybrid Robotic OR, 
j. 1 Endovascular Monoplane Hybrid OR, 
k. 2 Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory, 
l. 1 Electrophysiology Procedure Room, and 
m. 1 Transesophageal Echocardiograph (TEE) Procedure Room 
3. Inpatient Complex Surgical Complexity: twenty-three ranges: 
a. 2 to 4 General ORs, 
b. 1 or 2 Urology/Cystoscopy ORs, 
c. 2 Orthopedic ORs,  
d. 2 Cardiovascular ORs, 
e. 1 Neurosurgical OR, 
f. 1 Robotics OR, 
g. 1 Transplant OR, 
h. 2 Hybrid Monoplane ORs, 
i. 2 Hybrid Biplane ORs, 
j. 1 Hybrid Robotic OR, 
k. 2 Endovascular Monoplane Hybrid OR, 
l. 2 Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory, 
m. 1 Electrophysiology Procedure Room, and 
n. 1 Transesophageal Echocardiograph (TEE) Procedure Room 
4. Basic Ambulatory Center: four ranges: 
a. 1 to 4 General ORs, and 
5. Advanced Ambulatory Center: six ranges: 
a. 1 to 5 General ORs, and 
b. 1 Urology/Cystoscopy OR. 
F. The SPCM metrics are translated into one (or more) Room Criteria Statement (RCS) for 
each room in Section 5 of this document. The SPCM Planning Range, the maximum 
number of ORs is varies by Complexity Level as detailed above. If a project shall require 
provision of workload driven rooms above the maximum range value refer to CFM for 
guidance. Rooms in this space planning document are organized in 11 IP and 9 AMB 
Functional Areas (FAs). 
G. Based on its intended function, each room / space is assigned a: 
1. Room Name (RN), 
2. Room Code (RC), 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA February 1, 2023 
286 – Surgical / Endovascular Services 
13 of 76 
3. Room Area, the Net Square Feet (NSF) and its corresponding “soft metric” Net 
Square Meters (NSM), 
4. Unique Room Criteria Statement(s) (RCSs) correlated to answers to Input Data 
Statements (IDSs), and 
5. Room Comment as needed. 
H. The Room Codes included in this chapter stem from the VA Room Family. A unique 
support space, that may have variable area, is assigned a unique Room Code, and 
adopts the square footage, as needed, correlated to the room contents assigned which 
in turn correspond to the range for those rooms. A unique clinical space or a direct 
clinical support room, i.e., control room, system components room, etc. typically does 
not feature variable NSF. Patient Care room names for rooms unique to this chapter end 
in “, Surg Svc”. Patient Care Support room names end in “, Bldg Sprt”, “Clncl Sprt”, “Stff 
Sprt”, or “, Vet Sprt”, correlating to Building, Clinical, Staff or Veteran Support room 
families. 
I. Section 5, Sub-Section F lists the SEPS Importer Shortcuts used for implementation of 
Sections 4 & 5 in SEPS. These shortcuts are inserted into the Room Criteria Statement 
(RCS) for each room which upon upload into the Space and Equipment Planning System 
(SEPS) allowing planners developing VA healthcare projects to determine quantity and 
square footage of each room by performing mathematical or logical calculations. 
Shortcuts refer Input Data Statements (IDSs), Rooms or calculation parameters 
stemming from the SPCM. 
J. SEPS is accessible to government healthcare planners and private sector consultants 
working on VA HC projects during their Period of Performance (PoP) through the 
MAX.gov website; government provided Training is a requisite for access. 
K. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross factor (NTDG) factor of 1.70 for Surgical / 
Endovascular Services and a Building Gross factor of 1.35 in the space calculation to 
generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross Square Feet 
(BGSF) respectively for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet 
(NSF) for each range. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the NTDG factor is 
fixed. 
L. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-5 Equipment Guidelist for the Room Content 
assignment for each room during the planning phase of a project. 
M. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-12: Design Guide, if available, during the 
planning and design phases of a project. Not all PG-18-9 clinical chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 document, please refer to the VA-TIL. 
N. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website.

O. Per VHA policy, VA medical facilities with an inpatient Surgical Program shall: 
1. have a surgical complexity designation of either Standard, Intermediate, or Complex 
that determines the functions and spaces that will be provided; and 
2. the scheduled (non-emergent) surgical procedures performed, are not to exceed the 
infrastructure capabilities of the facility. 
P. Per VHA policy, VA medical facilities with an Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC) shall: 
1. have a surgical complexity designation of either Basic or Advanced that determines 
the functions and spaces that will be provided; and 
2. the scheduled (non-emergent) surgical procedures performed, are not to exceed the 
infrastructure capabilities of the facility. 
Q. There is no direct correlation with demand and the Operative Complexity designation of 
the facility, although facilities with >50k patient uniques assigned tend to be Inpatient 
Complex. 
R. Facility Operative Complexity designation is associated with a variable number of 
surgeon provider FTEs by specialty. Cardiothoracic Surgery, Neurosurgery, and Plastic 
Surgery FTEs are only associated with Inpatient facilities with a surgical complexity 
designation of Complex. 
S. VHA “operative complexity” establishes the infrastructure that is required at a VHA 
facility in relationship to the complexity of the surgical procedures being performed. 
This requirement ensures that the scope of the surgical procedure is within the 
capability of the facility. This requirement makes sure that surgeries are performed 
under the safest possible conditions. 
T. Provision of services such as diagnostic evaluation; consultation; surgical physician 
staffing; operating room staffing, instruments, equipment, coverage, and radiology; 
anesthesia services; post anesthesia care unit; intensive care unit; inpatient surgical 
unit; supply, processing, and distribution; and other support services shall be provided 
based on the assignment of the complexity level of the Surgical / Endovascular Services 
assigned. 
Examples of procedures by complexity designation are: 
1. Appendectomy (removal of the appendix) in Inpatient Standard. 
2. Shoulder joint reconstruction in Inpatient Intermediate. 
3. Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), a type of open heart surgery in Inpatient 
Complex. 
4. Surgical removal of a skin cancer in an Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC) Basic. 
5. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder) in an Ambulatory 
Surgery Center (ASC) Advanced.

8 PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. General 
1. The location of support services should be considered in the design of the Surgical 
Suite to provide efficient and timely flow of staff, supplies, and equipment. 
2. Visual and acoustic privacy is a prime consideration in the design of the Surgical 
Suite. Minimizing sound transmission is important for patient privacy and helps 
protect dissemination of their personal information. This is particularly important in 
examination, treatment, and procedure areas. Visual privacy provides the patient 
with a more dignified environment and promotes higher patient satisfaction. 
3. Inclusion of natural light and views to the outside has a positive effect on patient 
outcomes and staff satisfaction and should be provided whenever possible. 
4. Incorporate the requirements for Bariatric, SCI/D patients, and other patients with 
special needs when designing the Surgical Suite. 
5. Separate patient and staff area / circulation to promote an on-stage / off-stage 
organizational concept. On-stage areas provide patients and family members a high 
level of patient privacy, safety, and ease of wayfinding. Separation of patients and 
their family from staff and support areas contributes to provide a calmer healing 
environment. 
6. Three distinct levels of access requirements are incorporated into the design of the 
Surgical Suite. These include: 
a. Unrestricted areas: Patient and visitor access and traffic is not limited, and street 
clothes are permitted. 
b. Semi-restricted: Access and traffic is limited to authorized personnel. Semi- 
restricted areas include peripheral support areas that surround the restricted 
area such as scrub stations, storage areas for clean and sterile supplies and 
medical equipment, as well as corridors leading to the restricted area. All surgical 
personnel and visitors shall follow the Recommended Practices for Surgical Attire 
by the Association of Perioperative Nursing (AORN). 
c. Restricted: A designated area in the semi-restricted zone of the surgical suite 
that can only be accessed through a semi-restricted space. This is a high level of 
asepsis area with controlled access. Personnel in restricted areas are required to 
wear surgical attire and cover head and facial hair. Masks are required where 
open sterile supplies or scrubbed persons may be located. All Operating Rooms 
and Endovascular Rooms and their associated spaces are classified as Restricted. 
7. Consider provision of patient lifts in areas where the transfer of patients is needed. 
Ceiling mounted patient lifts prevent staff injury by eliminating the need for staff 
physically lifting the patient. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA February 1, 2023 
286 – Surgical / Endovascular Services 
69 of 76 
8. Separate the flow of clean medical supplies, instruments, and linen from soiled and 
unused materials to prevent cross-contamination. 
9. Accommodation for the isolation of infectious patients shall be provided in Airborne 
Infection Isolation (AII) patient rooms and considerations given to how these 
patients access the area in order to prevent cross-contamination with other 
patients. 
10. Consideration should be given to the effects of building vibration, as building 
vibration can interfere with the accuracy of surgical instruments and equipment. 
11. Patient corridors shall be a minimum dimension of 8’0” clear to accommodate 
wheelchairs, gurneys, and the movement of equipment and supplies. 
B. Reception Area 
1. General Waiting 
a. Families waiting during surgical procedures experience a high level of stress. 
Waiting areas should be designed to provide a comfortable, soothing, and non- 
stressful environment. This is accomplished by creating a “homelike” 
environment with comfortable furniture and a calming color scheme. Waiting 
times can be very long depending on the surgical procedure and the waiting area 
should support different types of activities which may include reading, cell 
phone use, television viewing, and work. These activities should be separated 
into “activity zones” to address the different requirements of each type of 
activity. Appropriate amenities and technology should also be provided to 
support these activities. 
2. Reception / Registration 
The two types of patient reception / registration include a reception desk and / or 
electronic kiosks. The reception desk provides personal contact which can help to 
reduce patient and family stress while the electronic kiosk helps to improve 
efficiency. Both are of equal importance and the design should provide ease of 
access to both. 
3. Consult Room 
The consult room is used for interaction between family members and surgical staff. 
Patient status may be shared with family in this space, and it should be provided 
with both visual and acoustical privacy. A “homelike” environment is desirable and 
can be accomplished through the selection of furniture and color scheme. 
C. Pre-Operative Assessment Unit Area 
1. This area may be located adjacent to the surgical suite with direct connection to the 
Reception Area. An alternate location may be near the main entrance to the 
healthcare facility to provide patient convenience and ease of access. 
2. Consideration should be given to the proximity of this area to associated support 
services. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA February 1, 2023 
286 – Surgical / Endovascular Services 
70 of 76 
3. Inclusion of a Team Room is not required in Standard Inpatient and Basic 
Ambulatory facilities. 
D. Pre-operative Holding / Phase II Recovery 
1. Provide a patient / family-centered physical environment to reduce patient and 
family stress associated with the onset and recovery from a surgical procedure and 
to accommodate family members who are accompanying the patient. Items to 
consider are reducing lighting intensity and glare, providing individual TVs and 
access to Wi-Fi. Durable and easy to clean finishes that convey a “homelike” 
environment and space for family seating are also required in this area. The 
inclusion of windows provides natural light, views to the outdoors, and a distraction 
while waiting and recovering from a surgical procedure. 
2. Merging the Pre-operative Holding and the Phase II Recovery provides flexibility to 
accommodate the different phases of patient prep and recovery. Typically, routine 
surgical procedures are scheduled in the morning which creates an increased need 
for patient prep at that time. The reverse is true later in the day as surgical 
procedures are completed and the need for Phase II recover exceeds the need for 
Pre-operative Holding. The patient bays and patient rooms shall be designed to 
accommodate both Pre-op and Phase II Recovery patients to allow for use by either 
type of patient. 
3. Provide direct visual access from the nurse station to all patient prep / recovery bays 
/ rooms. 
4. Consider the use of decentralized nurse stations to provide staff with improved 
access to patient “point-of-care”. Decentralized nurse stations reduce noise 
generated from one large nurse station and reduce staff walking distances. 
5. Patient Bays are designed with solid partitions on three sides and a privacy curtain 
on the fourth side. This arrangement provides a higher level of visual and acoustical 
patient privacy. 
6. Patient Rooms are fully enclosed and are provided with four solid walls, one of 
which includes a door. The door must provide the ability for staff to monitor the 
patient and also provide patient privacy through the use of a privacy curtain or other 
methods of screening. 
7. Provide direct access for family members to Pre-Operative Holding / Phase II 
Recovery. Separate pre-procedure patient / family circulation from post-procedure 
patient / family circulation to minimize visual and acoustical interaction with post- 
procedure patients. 
E. Anesthesia Procedure Patient Area 
1. Anesthesia Procedure services are allocated, as authorized, for Standard, 
Intermediate, and Complex Inpatient Surgical Facilities and Basic and Advanced 
Ambulatory Surgery Centers. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA February 1, 2023 
286 – Surgical / Endovascular Services 
71 of 76 
F. Surgical and Endovascular Patient Areas 
1. General ORs are provided only in Standard Inpatient Surgical Facilities. General and 
Specialty ORs are provided in Intermediate Inpatient Surgical Facilities. General, 
Specialty and Hybrid ORs are provided in Complex Inpatient Surgical Facilities. 
2. General ORs are provided in Ambulatory Surgery Centers (ASCs) regardless their 
complexity level. 
3. Endovascular Service is provided only in Complex Inpatient Surgical Facilities. 
4. Access to the ORs shall be provided from the semi-restricted corridor for patient and 
staff and from the Clean Core Area for access to equipment and supplies. 
5. Include infrastructure to support the trend towards integration to allow ORs to 
incorporate new integration technology as it develops. Technology platform 
integration including endoscopic viewing, video integration, digital recording 
systems, and on-demand provider software are to be considered in the design of 
ORs. 
6. OR communication requirements include virtual whiteboards, workflow 
management software, real time location systems, and patient safety displays. 
7. Include systems for integrated image routing. This will simplify the management of 
feeds from multiple video sources and will make intra-operative imaging more 
efficient. 
8. In order to provide redundant control for medical equipment such as lights, booms 
and monitors during a procedure, nursing stations may be provided inside ORs. 
9. Operating Room finishes shall promote ease of clean-ability. A continuous resinous 
floor with integral base extending no less than six inches about the finished floor will 
be specified. Floor drains are not permitted. 
10. Locate scrub sinks directly outside the operating room and in the semi-restricted 
corridor. Provide visual access from the scrub sink area into the operating room. 
G. Clean Core Area 
1. This area holds the supplies and equipment needed for a procedure in a sterile 
environment. Direct access from the ORs shall be provided. A Clean Core Area shall 
serve a minimum of two and a maximum of eight ORs in a "pod" configuration. 
2. Operating Rooms shall be designed around the clean core area to separate clean 
from soiled supplies and equipment in order to prevent cross-contamination and 
address universal precautions and aseptic techniques. 
3. The Surgical Suite shall be restricted from public and non-authorized staff. 
H. Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) / Phase I Recovery Patient Area 
1. The PACU should be located in close proximity to the operating rooms and adjacent 
to Pre-operative Holding / Phase II Recovery 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA February 1, 2023 
286 – Surgical / Endovascular Services 
72 of 76 
2. Acoustical and visual privacy is a major consideration the design of the PACU and 
should be taken into account when locating nursing and other staff / support areas 
within the PACU Patient Area. 
3. Provide direct visual access by staff to all patient bays and rooms within the PACU. 
I. Support Area 
1. Locate support spaces to provide an efficient flow of supplies and to minimize staff 
travel distances. 
2. In addition to the basic support spaces allocated for Inpatient and Ambulatory 
Surgical Facilities, a Satellite Laboratory, Frozen Section Laboratory, and Satellite 
Pharmacy may be included in Inpatient Intermediate and Complex facilities. 
J. Staff and Administrative Area 
1. Locate staff and administrative areas adjacent to clinical areas to minimize staff 
travel distances. 
2. On-call rooms are provided for Inpatient Surgical Facilities. Locate Surgical On- call 
facilities adjacent to the Surgical Suite to accommodate quick response time by oncall
staff. 
3. Biomedical Engineering space is provided for Intermediate and Complex Inpatient 
Surgical Facilities. 
K. Inpatient Surgical Facility Education Area 
1. Surgical education is provided for Inpatient Surgical Facilities. 
2. Locate education space adjacent to the Staff and Administration Area for ease of 
staff access.

1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines Space Planning Criteria for Chapter 287: Gastrointestinal / 
Endoscopy Service. It applies to all medical facilities at the Department of Veterans Affairs 
(VA). 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Colonoscopy: Examination of the entire length of the colon, or large intestine, using an 
endoscope to detect early signs of cancer, inflamed tissue, abnormal growths, ulcers, 
and/or bleeding in the colon or rectum. 
Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): A diagnostic procedure that 
enables the physician to diagnose problems in the liver, gallbladder, bile ducts, and 
pancreas. ERCP combines the use of X-Rays and an endoscope, which is a long, flexible, 
lighted tube. Through the endoscope, the physician can see the inside of the stomach and 
duodenum, and inject dyes into the ducts in the biliary tree and pancreas so they can be 
seen clearly on X-Rays. X-Rays are taken as soon as the dye is injected. ERCP procedures can 
take between 30 minutes to 2 hours. 
Endoscopy: A medical examination that involves viewing a body cavity, such as the stomach, 
with a tube-like instrument called an endoscope. Endoscopy uses cameras and video 
recorders to make permanent records of the appearance of internal organs. Endoscopy 
procedures may be diagnostic and/or therapeutic and are generally performed under 
topical or general anesthesia. Most procedures are done in an outpatient setting. 
Esophageal Manometry: Also called Esophageal Motility Study, uses a catheter to measure 
esophageal pressure and records the duration and sequence of contractions in the 
esophagus. 
Esophageal Motility Study: See Esophageal Manometry. 
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD): Endoscopic examination of the esophagus, stomach 
and duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). Also called Upper Endoscopy. 
Flexible Sigmoidoscopy: See Sigmoidoscopy. 
Fluoroscopy: The radiographic technique used to produce and evaluate real time motion. A 
non-ionic contrast material is injected or consumed by the patient to enhance visualization 
of various organs. A constant stream of radiation passes through the patient and strikes a 
fluorescent screen creating shadows of the opaque internal organs. Images produced by 
this modality include upper and lower gastrointestinal series, cystography, pyelography, and 
esophageal mobility studies. 
Gastroenterology Laboratory: Used for performing tests such as gastric analysis and 
esophageal manometry. It would be included in the Endoscopy Suite when approved by the 
authorized program official. 
Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS): The digital capture, transfer, and 
storage of diagnostic images. A PACS system consists of: workstations for interpretation, 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
287 – Gastroenterology/Endoscopy Service 
3 of 4 
image / data producing modalities, a web server for distribution, printers for file records, 
image servers for information transfer and holding, and an archive of off-line information. A 
computer network is needed to support digital imaging devices. 
Sigmoidoscopy: A diagnostic procedure that allows the physician to examine the lower onethird
of the large intestine. Sigmoidoscopy is helpful in identifying the causes of diarrhea, 
abdominal pain, constipation, abnormal growths, and bleeding. It may also be used to 
obtain biopsies and to perform procedures such as the removal of polyps or hemorrhoids. A 
short, flexible, lighted tube, called a sigmoidoscope, is inserted into the intestine through 
the rectum into the lower part of the large intestine. Air is injected into the intestine 
through the sigmoidoscope to inflate it for better viewing. 
Upper Endoscopy: See Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Accessible: A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with provisions outlined 
in the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA). 
Architectural Barriers Act (ABA): A set of standards developed to ensure that all buildings 
financed with federal funds are designed and constructed to be fully accessible to everyone. 
This law requires all construction, renovation, or leasing of sites, facilities, buildings, and 
other elements, financed with federal funds, to comply with the Architectural Barriers Act 
Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). The ABAAS replaces the Uniform Federal Accessibility 
Standards (UFAS). 
Average Length of Encounter (ALoE): Averaged length of time, in minutes, a patient spends 
in an Exam / Treatment Room interacting with a provider and the clinical support team. It is 
accounted from room “set-up” to “clean-up” by staff. This metric is used to determine the 
number of annual patient / provider encounters that take place in an Exam / Treatment 
Room which, in turn, is used to calculate the number of Exam / Treatment Rooms needed in 
a facility based on projected annual workload. The ALoE is determined with VHA SME input 
during a PG-18-9 clinical chapter revision / update. 
Average Length of Stay (ALoS): The average number of days a patient Veteran stays in an 
inpatient care unit. The ALoS is used to calculate the number of patient bedrooms for a 
specialty by dividing the site’s projected workload by the ALoS. 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Clinic Stop: Per these criteria, a clinic stop is the workload unit of measure for space 
planning. Clinic Stops are codified by VSSC, when applicable, they are referenced by number 
in the calculation of workload driven patient care spaces in this document. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
287 – Gastroenterology/Endoscopy Service 
4 of 5 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet

PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Provider: An individual who examines, diagnoses, treats, prescribes medication, and 
manages the care of patients within his or her scope of practice as established by the 
governing body of a healthcare organization. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
Room Efficiency Factor: A factor that provides flexibility in the utilization of a room to 
account for patient delays, scheduling conflicts, and equipment maintenance. Common 
factors are in the 75% to 85% range. A room with 80% room efficiency provides a buffer to 
assume that this room would be available 20% of the time beyond the planned operational 
practices for this room. This factor may be adjusted based on the actual and/or anticipated 
operations and processes of the room/department at a particular facility. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts.

Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
Stop Code: A measure of workload including clinic stops forecasted by the Office of Policy 
and Planning (OPP) for all Strategic Planning Categories at Medical Center and Outpatient 
Clinic levels. 
Telehealth: The use of technology, such as computers and mobile devices, to manage 
healthcare remotely. It includes a variety of health care services, including but not limited to 
online support groups, online health information and self-management tools, email and 
online communication with health care providers, remote monitoring of vital signs, video, 
or online doctor visits. Depending on the concept of operations for this space, it may be 
equipped as an exam room or as a consult room with video/camera capability. 
Utilization Rate: A factor used in the calculation of a directly workload-driven room 
throughput. It represents, in a percent value, the room is idle based on the planning 
assumptions. For example, if a directly workload-driven room is available for use 8 hours a 
day, the Utilization Rate represents the assumed time it will be actually be used, an 85% 
utilization rate indicates, for planning purposes, the room will be used 6.8 hours a day. An 
additional directly workload-driven room will be provided in the calculation once the 
previous room has reached 100% utilization. The utilization Rate is embedded in the Room 
Throughput value calculated in Section 3 of this document. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/

Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
Workstation: Area outfitted with equipment and furnishings, typically allocated 56 NSF 
each. Managers and other staff with no direct reports as well as part-time, seasonal, and 
job-sharing staff may qualify for a workstation. Such environments are particularly 
conducive to team-oriented office groupings. These environments work best when they 
have access to conference and small group meeting spaces. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space planning criteria included in this Standard have been specifically developed for 
this Department / Service in a Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare facility based 
on established VHA policy and guidelines to define the scope of services provided for 
the existing workload demand as well as that in the foreseeable future. Rooms and 
Functional Areas are provided based on research of clinical and non-clinical activities 
performed in this Department. 
B. Development / update of VA’s Program Guide (PG) standards is a research based effort 
executed with participation of VHA Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), VA-Construction and 
Facilities Management Office (CFM) professional staff and specialty consultants hired for 
the task. These space planning standards are based on current applicable VHA policies 
and guidelines, established and/or anticipated best practice standards, and latest 
medical technology developments. Workload metrics were tailored to satisfy current 
and anticipated veteran workload demand. 
C. The space planning component of PG-18-9 is based on the Space Planning Concept 
Matrix (SPCM) which lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and assigns room 
quantity (Q) and area (NSF) for a series of ranges corresponding to the smallest to the 
largest department for this service in the VA healthcare system in incremental size; each 
range corresponds to a workload parameter which determines the number and area of 
each directly workload-driven room. The remainder of the rooms in the range i.e., 
waiting, storage, staff workstations, etc. are determined by ratios to the resulting 
number of or NSF of the workload-driven rooms. 
D. Sections 4 and 5 of these space planning standards as well as the PG-18-5 standard are 
implemented in the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) and hosted at the 
MAX.gov website so planners working on VA Construction projects can develop single or 
multi-department projects based on these PG-18-9- and the PG-18-5 standards. Output 
from SEPS is through Space and Contents Reports; the Space Report is the Program for 
Design (PFD), the Content Report is the Project Room Contents (PRC). Inclusion of a 
Functional Area as well as Room quantity (Q) and determination of the room area (NSF) 
in the PFD is based on the projected Workload input which triggers calculations included 
in the Room Criteria Statements (RCSs). The RCSs are placed immediately after each 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
287 – Gastroenterology/Endoscopy Service 
8 of 9 
room name, room code and baseline area (NSF). The PRC list the medical equipment, 
furniture and fixtures associated to each Room Code in the project. The PFD & PRC are 
the baseline requirements for the planning phase of a VA project based on a site’s 
projected workload for the target planning year. This chapter’s corresponding PG-18-12, 
Design Guide -if available- is intended for use during the design phase of the project. 
E. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the 
Gastrointestinal / Endoscopy Service Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed 
as the basis for this chapter. The Gastrointestinal / Endoscopy Service SPCM lists all the 
spaces a VA Gastrointestinal / Endoscopy Service site would require; the quantity and 
NSF for each room is calculated based on the Gastrointestinal / Endoscopy Service 
projected workload or number of FTE positions authorized. The SPCM is organized in 20 
ranges, each range represents an incremental workload value equivalent to one Patient 
Care Room, this way all current VA Gastrointestinal / Endoscopy Service sites are 
covered in the SPCM. The upper ranges are calculated for future facilities in case a 
higher projected workload. The 20 SPCM ranges are organized as follows: 
1. Ranges 1 to 4: Colonoscopy Stop Code 321* between 480 and 6,400 annual 
procedures (in increments of 1,600) 
2. Ranges 5 to 7: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) Stop Code 321* between 640 
and 6,399 annual procedures (in increments of 2,133) 
3. Ranges 8 to 10: Esophageal Manometry Stop Code 321* between 480 and 4,800 
annual procedures (in increments of 1,600) 
4. Ranges 11 to 13: Flexible Sigmoidoscopy Stop Code 321* between 960 and 9,600 
annual procedures (in increments of 3,200 
5. Ranges 14 to 16: Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) Stop 
Code 321*between 225 and 2,250 annual procedures (in increments of 750) 
6. Ranges 17 to 20: Endoscopic Ultrasound Stop Code 321*between 225 and 3,000 
annual procedures (in increments of 750 
* Stop Code 321 incorporates the six procedure types above. As the procedures 
referenced in the first four ranges are performed in the Endoscopy Procedure Room 
(FA2:RM1) and those in the remaining two ranges in the ERCP / Endoscopic 
Ultrasound Procedure Room (FA2:RM2), the annual throughputs assigned to those 
rooms are averaged accordingly. 
F. This way all current VA Gastrointestinal / Endoscopy Service sites are covered, the upper 
ranges are calculated for future facilities in case a higher projected workload or FTE 
positions authorized than those at the present time for this Service. 
G. The SPCM metrics are translated into one (or more) Room Criteria Statement (RCS) for 
each room in Section 5 of this document. The SPCM Planning Range, the maximum 
number of directly workload-driven patient care rooms, in this document is 10. If a 
project shall require provision of workload driven rooms above the maximum range 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
287 – Gastroenterology/Endoscopy Service 
9 of 10 
value refer to CFM for guidance. Rooms in this space planning document are organized 
in 5 Functional Areas (FAs). 
H. Based on its intended function, each room / space is assigned a: 
1. Room Name (RN), 
2. Room Code (RC), 
3. Room Area, the Net Square Feet (NSF) and its corresponding “soft metric” Net 
Square Meters (NSM), 
4. Unique Room Criteria Statement(s) (RCSs) correlated to answers to Input Data 
Statements (IDSs), and 
5. Room Comment as needed. 
I. The Room Codes included in this chapter stem from the VA Room Family. A unique 
support space, that may have variable area, is assigned a unique Room Code and adopts 
the square footage, as needed, correlated to the room contents assigned which in turn 
correspond to the range for those rooms. A unique clinical space or a direct clinical 
support room, i.e., control room, system components room, etc. typically does not 
feature variable NSF. Patient Care room names for rooms unique to this chapter end in 
“, GI-Endo Svc”. Patient Care Support room names end in “, Bldg Sprt”, “Clncl Sprt”, “Stff 
Sprt”, or “, Vet Sprt”, correlating to Building, Clinical, Staff or Veteran Support room 
families. 
J. Section 5, Sub-Section F lists the SEPS Importer Shortcuts used for implementation of 
Sections 4 & 5 in SEPS. These shortcuts are inserted into the Room Criteria Statement 
(RCS) for each room which upon upload into the Space and Equipment Planning System 
(SEPS) allowing planners developing VA healthcare projects to determine quantity and 
square footage of each room by performing mathematical or logical calculations. 
Shortcuts refer Input Data Statements (IDSs), Rooms or calculation parameters 
stemming from the SPCM. 
K. SEPS is accessible to government healthcare planners and private sector consultants 
working on VA HC projects during their Period of Performance (PoP) through the 
MAX.gov website; government provided Training is a requisite for access. 
L. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross factor (NTDG) factor of 1.50 for 
Gastrointestinal / Endoscopy Service and a Building Gross factor of 1.35 in the space 
calculation to generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building 
Gross Square Feet (BGSF) respectively for the project based on the aggregate resulting 
Net Square Feet (NSF) for each range. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the 
NTDG factor is fixed. 
M. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-5 Equipment Guidelist for the Room Content 
assignment for each room during the planning phase of a project. 
N. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-12: Design Guide, if available, during the 
planning and design phases of a project. Not all PG-18-9 clinical chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 document, please refer to the VA-TIL.

6 PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. Separation of inpatient and outpatient traffic should be considered to the greatest 
extent possible. Provide Reception / Check-in for outpatient separate from inpatient 
circulation when both patient types utilize the same departmental facilities. 
B. Standardization of rooms and modular design should be considered to allow flexibility to 
adapt to new technologies and respond to changes in patient volumes. 
C. Consideration should be given to incorporating new technologies for care delivery, such 
as “camera in a pill.” New technologies hold the potential to reduce the quantity and/or 
area of procedure rooms in a Gastrointestinal / Endoscopy Service. 
D. Connection to ancillary services, such as lab and pharmacy, should be considered. 
E. The waiting room should be connected to the patient entrance corridor and be under 
the visual control of the receptionist. This space can be shared between adjacent 
services where appropriate. 
F. Design should accommodate patient privacy and confidentiality in all areas, and in 
reception and patient care areas in particular. This includes visual and auditory 
considerations. 
G. Where possible, the department should be configured to limit the mix of patient and 
service functions, and to maintain clear separation of clean and dirty functions to avoid 
cross contamination. For example, Clean and Soiled Utility rooms can be located at 
alternate ends of a department. 
H. Corridors should be designed to a minimum of 8 feet clear width to accommodate 
passage of equipment or beds and two stretchers and/or wheelchairs. In non-patient 
areas and outpatient clinical spaces, corridors may be a minimum of 5 feet in clear 
width. 
I. Administration and support areas should be located and designed to maximize staff and 
space efficiency, and reduce staff travel distances. 
J. Plan for locating high volume services closer to patient waiting or building access points 
to decrease patient travel time/distance and increase staff responsiveness. Services with 
longer duration procedure times or low volume generation can be less centrally located. 
K. Sharing of patient and staff support areas among adjacent services should be 
considered for efficient utilization of staff. For example, centralized check-in / check- out 
can reduce the total number of FTE’s required to provide this function over multiple 
service lines. 
L. During design, NSF for Staff Lounge and Lockers may be combined with an adjacent 
department(s). 
M. Verify room sizes and equipment layouts with equipment vendors prior to finalizing 
room layouts.

2 of 10 
1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines Space Planning Criteria for Chapter 290: Voluntary Service. It applies 
to all medical facilities at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning system (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
290– Voluntary Service 
3 of 10 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
290– Voluntary Service 
4 of 10 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Voluntary 
Service Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as a basis for this chapter. The 
SPCM lists all the spaces a VA Voluntary Service site would require; the quantity and NSF 
for each room is calculated based on the number of VAVS Organizations represented in 
the VAVS Hospital Advisory Committee organized in twenty ranges each corresponding 
to one VAVS Organization. 
B. The room quantity (Q) and area (NSF) values included for each range in the SPCM are 
reflected in the Room Criteria Statements, placed immediately below each room name, 
room code and NSF/NSM, for each room in Section 5 of this document. The number of 
VAVS Organizations is included in the Input Data Statements (IDSs) in Section 4. Both 
Sections are implemented in the Space Planning and Equipment System (SEPS) software 
accessible through the MAX.gov website. Planners programming a VA Voluntary Service 
project shall develop a baseline Program for Design (PFD) in SEPS. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022

5 of 10 
C. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross (NTDG) factor of 1.20 for Voluntary 
Service and a Building Gross (BG) factor of 1.35 in the space calculation. These factors 
generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross Square Feet 
(BGSF) for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet (NSF) for all 
Departments included. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the NTDG factor is 
fixed. 
D. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website.

Ultrasound: An imaging modality using high frequency sound waves to determine the size 
and shape of internal vessels, organs, or structures based on the differential rates of 
reflection. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Accessible: A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with provisions outlined 
in the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA). 
Architectural Barriers Act (ABA): A set of standards developed to ensure that all buildings 
financed with federal funds are designed and constructed to be fully accessible to everyone. 
This law requires all construction, renovation, or leasing of sites, facilities, buildings, and 
other elements, financed with federal funds, to comply with the Architectural Barriers Act 
Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). The ABAAS replaces the Uniform Federal Accessibility 
Standards (UFAS). 
Average Length of Encounter (ALoE): Averaged length of time, in minutes, a patient spends 
in an Exam / Treatment Room interacting with a provider and the clinical support team. It is 
accounted from room “set-up” to “clean-up” by staff. This metric is used to determine the 
number of annual patient / provider encounters that take place in an Exam / Treatment 
Room which, in turn, is used to calculate the number of Exam / Treatment Rooms needed in 
a facility based on projected annual workload. The ALoE is determined with VHA SME input 
during a PG-18-9 clinical chapter revision / update. 
Average Length of Stay (ALoS): The average number of days a patient Veteran stays in an 
inpatient care unit. The ALoS is used to calculate the number of patient bedrooms for a 
specialty by dividing the site’s projected workload by the ALoS. 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Clinic Stop: Per these criteria, a clinic stop is the workload unit of measure for space 
planning. Clinic Stops are codified by VSSC, when applicable, they are referenced by number 
in the calculation of workload driven patient care spaces in this document. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Encounter: An interaction between a patient Veteran and a VA provider or providers in an 
Exam Room / Treatment Room / Consultation Room / Procedure Room, spaces where a 
patient Veteran received clinical care.

PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs.  
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5

account for patient delays, scheduling conflicts, and equipment maintenance. Common 
factors are in the 75% to 85% range. A room with 80% room efficiency provides a buffer to 
assume that this room would be available 20% of the time beyond the planned operational 
practices for this room. This factor may be adjusted based on the actual and/or anticipated 
operations and processes of the room/department at a particular facility. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
295 – Imaging Service 
7 of 67 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
Stop Code: A measure of workload including clinic stops forecasted by the Office of Policy 
and Planning (OPP) for all Strategic Planning Categories at Medical Center and Outpatient 
Clinic levels. 
Telehealth: The use of technology, such as computers and mobile devices, to manage 
healthcare remotely. It includes a variety of health care services, including but not limited to 
online support groups, online health information and self-management tools, email and 
online communication with health care providers, remote monitoring of vital signs, video, 
or online doctor visits. Depending on the concept of operations for this space, it may be 
equipped as an exam room or as a consult room with video/camera capability. 
Utilization Rate: A factor used in the calculation of a directly workload-driven room 
throughput. It represents, in a percent value, the room is idle based on the planning 
assumptions. For example, if a directly workload-driven room is available for use 8 hours a 
day, the Utilization Rate represents the assumed time it will be used, an 85% utilization rate 
indicates, for planning purposes, the room will be used 6.8 hours a day. An additional 
directly workload-driven room will be provided in the calculation once the previous room 
has reached 100% utilization. The utilization Rate is embedded in the Room Throughput 
value calculated in Section 3 of this document. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
Workstation: Area outfitted with equipment and furnishings, typically allocated 56 NSF 
each. Managers and other staff with no direct reports as well as part-time, seasonal, and 
job-sharing staff may qualify for a workstation. Such environments are particularly 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
295 – Imaging Service 
8 of 67 
conducive to team-oriented office groupings. These environments work best when they 
have access to conference and small group meeting spaces. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space planning criteria have been developed based on research of clinical and nonclinical
activities performed in the functional areas of VA Imaging Services facilities. 
These criteria are predicated on established and/or anticipated best practice standards 
as well as applicable policy requirements for Imaging Services in the Department of 
Veterans Affairs and are the basis for generation of a baseline space program for the 
Imaging Services components of a VA construction project. These criteria are subject to 
modification and adjustment relative to developments in state-of-the-art equipment, 
medical practice, and subsequent detailed planning and design. 
B. Update of the PG-18-9, PG-18-5 & PG-18-12 Standards is a research based effort 
executed with participation of VHA Imaging Services Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), VAConstruction
and Facilities Management Office (CFM) professional staff and specialty 
consultants hired for the task. Based on a review of current applicable VHA policies and 
guidelines, and imaging technology developments the Space Planning Concept Matrix 
(SPCM) was developed. The SPCM details all the baseline components a VA Imaging 
Services department, renovation or new facility project, should include. The Functional 
Areas, Rooms, room quantities and square footages (NSFs) included in the PG-18-9 
standards document are based on the SPCM discussed, agreed upon by all participants 
and approved by VA VHA. 
C. The Imaging Services Planning Range, the maximum number of directly workload-driven 
imaging / scanning rooms, in this document is 40 imaging / scanning rooms – all 
modalities. The maximum number of imaging / scanning rooms by modality is as 
follows: 
1. General Radiography: 8 
2. Chest Radiography: 2 
3. Radiography / Fluoroscopy: 2 
4. Multipurpose Radiography / Fluoroscopy: 2 
5. Prone Breast Imaging: 1 
6. Standing Breast Imaging: 2 
7. ABUS Scanning: 1 
8. Ultrasound: 6 
9. Bone Densitometry: 1 
10. CT: 5 
11. MRI: 4 
12. Nuclear Medicine: 1 
13. SPECT/CT: 4 
14. Thyroid Probe: 1 
15. PET/CT: 2 
16. PET/MRI: 1 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
295 – Imaging Service 
9 of 67 
If a project requires provision of imaging / scanning rooms above these values, please 
refer to CFM for guidance. 
D. Rooms in the Imaging Services space planning document are organized in fourteen 
Functional Areas (FAs) as follows: 
1. FA 1: Imaging / Scanning Room Calculation 
2. FA 2: Imaging Services Reception Area 
3. FA 3: General Radiology Area 
4. FA 4: Breast Imaging Area 
5. FA 5: Ultrasound Area 
6. FA 6: Bone Densitometry Area 
7. FA 7: Computed Tomography (CT) Area 
8. FA 8: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Area 
9. FA 9: Nuclear Medicine (NM) Area 
10. FA 10: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Computed Tomography (CT) - PET/CT 
Area 
11. FA 11: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) - 
PET/MRI Area 
12. FA 12: Imaging Services Support Area 
13. FA 13: Imaging Services Staff and Administrative Area 
14. FA 14: Imaging Services Academic Education Area 
E. Based on its intended function, each room / space in a PG-18-9 Functional Area (FA) is 
assigned a: 
1. Room Name (RN), 
2. Room Code (RC), 
3. Room Area, the Net Square Feet (NSF) and its corresponding “soft metric” Net 
Square Meters (NSM), 
4. Unique Room Criteria Statement (RCS) correlated to answers to Input Data 
Statements (IDSs) or SEPS Importer Shortcuts (at end of Section 4), and 
5. Room Comment if needed. 
F. Section 4 Input Data Statements (IDSs) and Section 5 Space Planning Criteria in this 
document have been uploaded / implemented and tested in the Space and Equipment 
Planning System (SEPS), a web-based software for use in federal projects. Planners 
working on a VA Imaging Services project can develop a baseline space program, the 
Program for Design (PFD), by answering the IDSs in SEPS. These answers trigger 
mathematical and logical calculations embedded in the unique RCSs and generate the 
baseline PG-18-9 Standard-based PFD as the starting point of the project’s space 
planning process. Once the baseline space program has been vetted by the VISN / 
facility leadership, SEPS produces the list of contents for each room in the project based 
on the corresponding PG-18-5 Standard. 
G. Determination of the number of imaging and scanning rooms, the directly workload 
driven rooms, for a project is based on answers to the projected workload IDSs, please 
refer to item R below for the calculation methodology. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
295 – Imaging Service 
10 of 67 
H. Imaging Services modality Workload Projections for a specific VA Medical Center project 
are provided by the VHA Support Service Center (VSSC) or VA Central Office (VACO). The 
modality workload projections are generated by methodology based upon the expected 
veteran population in the respective market / service area. 
I. The modality projected workload is divided by the calculated annual room throughput 
(refer to Table 1) to determine the number of modality imaging / scanning rooms 
required. Assignment of Class 1 or Class 2 to the resulting number of modality imaging / 
scanning rooms is determined by the Facility Procedure Complexity Level (FPCL) 
designation (refer to Table 2). 
J. Determination of the number and NSF of most of the Reception, Clinical Support and 
Support rooms, the indirectly workload driven rooms, is based on assigned ratios 
correlating directly and indirectly workload driven rooms as detailed in the SPCM 
document. Additionally, some rooms are generated by answers to Mission or Staffing. 
K. Rooms in FA 2 Reception Area and FA 12 Support Area will generate if the total number 
combined imaging / scanning rooms in a project is between 1 and 43 except for Lowenergy
Isotope “hot” patient Waiting which correlates to the number of SPECT / Thyroid 
scanning rooms only. 
L. Clinical Patient Care rooms in FAs 3 through 11, will generate based on the ranges for 
each corresponding modality detailed in C, I and J above. 
M. Some office space as well as workrooms in FA 12 Staff and Administrative Area will 
generate based on answers to the staffing IDSs; the rest of the office spaces, 
workrooms, conference rooms, toilets, and showers will generate via ratios to the 1 – 40 
imaging / scanning room range. 
N. The Room Codes included in this chapter stem from the VA Room Family. A unique 
support space is assigned a unique Room Code and adopts the square footage, as 
needed, correlated to the room contents assigned which in turn corresponds to the 
imaging / scanning 1 to 40 range for those rooms in FAs 3 to 11. A unique clinical space 
or a direct clinical support room, i.e. control room, system components room, etc. 
typically does not feature variable NSF. Patient Care room names for rooms unique to 
this chapter end in “, Imgng Svcs”. Patient Care Support room names end in “, Bldg 
Sprt”, “Clncl Sprt”, “Stff Sprt”, or “, Vet Sprt”, correlating to Building, Clinical, Staff or 
Veteran Support room families. 
O. Section 5, sub-section O lists the SEPS Importer Shortcuts used during Sections 4 & 5 
implementation in SEPS. These shortcuts are inserted into the Room Criteria Statement 
(RCS) for each room which upon upload into the Space and Equipment Planning System 
(SEPS) allows planners developing VA healthcare projects determine quantity and 
square footage of each room by performing mathematical or logical calculations. 
Shortcuts can refer Input Data Statements (IDSs), Rooms or calculation parameters 
stemming from the SPCM.

P. The following Sections in this document have been implemented and tested in the 
Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS): 
1. Section 4: Input Data Statements, 
2. Section 5: Space Planning Criteria 
Q. SEPS is accessible to government healthcare planners and private sector consultants 
working on VA HC projects during their Period of Performance (PoP) through the 
MAX.gov website; government provided Training is a requisite for access. 
R. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross factor (NTDG) factor of 1.55 for Imaging 
Services and a Building Gross factor of 1.35 in the space calculation to generate the 
Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross Square Feet (BGSF) 
respectively for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet (NSF) for 
each range. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the NTDG factor is fixed. 
S. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-5 Equipment Guidelist for the Room Content 
assignment for each room during the planning phase of a project. 
T. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-12: Design Guide, if available, during the 
planning and design phases of a project. Not all PG-18-9 clinical chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 document, please refer to the VA-TIL. 
U. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website. 
V. Calculation of the workload-driven rooms is based on the following parameters: 
1. Operating days per year: 250 
2. Hours of Operation per day: 8 
3. Average length of modality encounter (ALoE) (in minutes): see Table 1 
4. Room Utilization: 85% of annual throughput 
Workload driven room annual throughput calculation: 
Operating days per year x Hours of operation per day / ALoE / 60 minutes== Annual 
Encounters 
Example: 
250 operating days per year x 8 hours of operation per day / 40 / 60 minutes 
 = 3,000 
3,000 annual encounters in an imaging / scanning rom assuming 100% utilization. 
3,000 x 85% = 2,550 annual capacity 
12,900 annual encounters / 2,550 = 5.05 Workload-Driven Rooms 
5 x 2,550 = 12,750 annual encounters

room be provided with an ASDU alcove proximate to the staff core entrance to the 
control room / alcove. When multiple modalities share a common staff core, ASDU 
alcoves may be merged (instead of repeated individual alcoves), and individual ASDU 
devices may be used for storage of materials for more than one imaging device or 
modality.

6 PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. For additional planning and design criteria, refer to the Department of Veterans Affairs 
(VA) Office of Construction & Facilities Management (CFM) Handbooks, Standards, 
Details, and Design Guides available at the VA-TIL. 
B. The location of the Imaging Service department within the medical facility should be 
readily accessible to both inpatients and outpatients, and in close proximity to the 
central patient vertical transportation system serving nursing units. At the same time, 
careful consideration should be given to limitation and control of public access within 
the Imaging department due to the potential safety hazards. 
C. Centralized check-in/check-out/scheduling for all imaging modalities allows for more 
efficient utilization of staff and space. Provisions should be made for in-person 
scheduling areas that preserve patient privacy. Refer to PG 18-12 Imaging Services for 
additional information. 
D. Locate holding areas adjacent to modalities that have a higher volume of inpatients and 
in relative proximity to the inpatient access point. Locate sub-waiting areas adjacent to 
modalities that have a higher volume of outpatient traffic. 
E. Public/patient corridors should be designed with a minimum of 8 feet clear width to 
accommodate passage of two stretchers and/or wheelchairs, equipment, or beds. 
Corridors in staff/support spaces with no public access can be 5 feet clear width. 
F. When planning an Imaging Service suite, centralized support should be considered to 
the greatest extent possible to maximize staff and space efficiency. Grouping of 
modalities with similar characteristics should also be considered when appropriate, in 
terms of staffing efficiencies or patient access (i.e. General Radiography and R/F, 
Ultrasound and Breast imaging, etc.). 
G. When planning an Imaging Service Suite, arrange multiple adjacent imaging / scanning 
rooms along a central work core that includes staff work areas, reading areas, 
equipment and apron storage, while segregating back-of-house staff circulation and 
patient circulation. The work core provides access to the individual control rooms, which 
then open to the scan rooms. 
H. Rooms used for quick-turnaround, high volume routine examinations (radiography of 
chest, abdomen, extremities, etc.) should be located closer to the reception and patient 
waiting areas or building access point to decrease patient travel time/distance and 
increase staff efficiency. Rooms used for longer duration procedures (R/F, Class-2, minor 
interventional procedures, etc.) can be located further away. 
I. Patient changing suites can be created by combining patient dressing rooms, personal 
property lockers, and a patient toilet, located between and accessing two scan rooms. 
Direct access from dressing room to scan room is also possible with this configuration. 
J. Imaging rooms are sized to accommodate transfer of patient from stretcher or hospital 
bed to table/equipment. 
K. Alcoves for parking mobile imaging equipment (portable X-ray, C-arm, Ultrasound), as 
well as for lead apron carts, crash carts, personal protective equipment carts, etc., 
should be recessed from corridors and work areas. Alcoves should be located to provide 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
295 – Imaging Service 
64 of 67 
quick access near the point of use, either within the Imaging Service or to support 
remote departments within the facility (Ambulatory Care, Inpatient Nursing Units, etc.). 
L. Staff facilities such as lockers, lounges, and staff toilets should be located within the 
Service and be convenient to employee assigned work areas, though separated from 
patient traffic flow. 
M. Consult with imaging equipment vendors for recommended and minimum room sizes 
and equipment layouts / clearances prior to finalizing planning documents. 
N. All scanning and procedure spaces should be planned with flexibility to accommodate 
the rapid technological improvements occurring in this field. When possible, plan for the 
entire Imaging Service to be located within a contiguous footprint on a single floor, 
preferably at exterior grade level. Locating scan rooms next to adjacent soft space 
provides the opportunity to expand the Imaging Service in place rather than needing to 
relocate the department. 
O. Consider access routes for replacement of large equipment (CT, MRI, PET/CT, etc.). If 
the Imaging Service aligns with an exterior wall of the building, plan for either a 
dedicated service entrance, or design a knock-out or removable wall section to facilitate 
equipment access. If located above grade, ensure freight elevator is of sufficient size 
and weight capacity to support the equipment. Structural floor load bearing capacity 
along the path from the elevator to the scan room should also be verified. 
P. Provide space to park stretcher/gurney while patient is undergoing an exam, either as a 
recessed corridor alcove, or directly within the scan room if sufficient space is available 
to avoid disruption of the exam/procedure functionality. 
Q. To address privacy concerns for female veterans, consider designing Breast Imaging 
services as a self-contained suite (i.e. Women’s Clinic) with dedicated reception and 
waiting space, dressing rooms, gowned waiting, and patient toilets. A portion of the 
Ultrasound and Bone Densitometry services may also be included within this suite, 
though male patients will still need access to these services. 
R. Modalities within Nuclear Medicine that utilize radioactive materials for imaging 
processes should be located in close proximity to the Radiopharmacy due to time 
sensitivity on decay of radioactive isotopes, as well as controlling distribution of 
hazardous materials. 
S. Nuclear Medicine service should have dedicated toilets for patients who have been 
administered a radioactive tracer compound to facilitate containment and clean-up of 
any bodily fluid spills. These toilets can be connected to the primary waste piping 
system, and do not require the dedicated waste line and decay tank system more 
commonly associated with Radiation Therapy treatment. 
T. The MRI suite should be functionally organized to separate staff and patient circulation 
as much as possible. Diagnostic rooms, processing functions, staff workstations, and 
staff support space should be organized contiguous to a centralized hub element for 
staff efficiency. Patient waiting and public areas should be organized in conjunction with 
a patient circulation element, which provides separate access to diagnostic rooms and 
dressing rooms. Layout of this space must be in compliance with all applicable VHA 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
295 – Imaging Service 
65 of 67 
directives, and the American College of Radiology guidelines – with the most restrictive 
guidance taking precedence. 
U. Storage areas for supplies should be planned in coordination with and in close proximity 
to the sections they will support. 
V. This Imaging Services Space Planning Criteria chapter provides accommodations for a 
multipurpose fluoroscopy procedure room intended for procedures that do not require 
a high-level Interventional Radiology suite. Refer to PG 18-9 Chapter 286: Surgical and 
Endovascular Services for complete planning information for Interventional Radiology 
services. 
W. In Section 8: Functional Diagram, 
a. Spaces labeled “Patient Preparation” refer to: General, Family and low-energy Isotope 
“hot” patient Waiting, Reception, Patient Dressing rooms, IV Start rooms, Medication 
Preparation rooms, Patient Waiting alcoves, Patient Toilets, Patient Holding bays, Nurse 
Stations, alcoves and storage rooms, and Patient / Public circulation areas. 
b. Spaces labeled “Work Core” refer to: PACS 3D workstations, Automated Supply 
Dispenser units (ASDUs), Crash Cart alcoves, Mobile X-Ray, Ultrasound, and Lead Apron 
alcoves, Clean Linen alcoves / rooms, Soiled Utility rooms, Supervisor, Chief 
Technologist, Radiation Safety Officer (RSO), and Imaging Physician Hoteling offices, 
Professional Non-Physician workstations, Trainee workstations, Teaching Reading / 
Consultation rooms, and staff circulation areas. 
c. Spaces labeled “Inpatient Holding” illustrates an option for centralized patient holding 
bays to gather inpatient holding in a centralized area for greater potential levels of 
observation and care. If exercised, it is understood that a collective inpatient holding 
area would decrease the number of individualized patient holding bays used within 
modality-level suite.

1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document provides Space Planning Criteria for Chapter 308: Prosthetics and Sensory 
Aids Service as it applies to all medical facilities at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Prosthetics and Sensory Aids Service: A specialized program designed to provide prosthetic 
/ orthotic services to the disabled beneficiary. Prosthetic services are distinguished as 
functions related to the replacement of missing parts of the body. Orthotic services are 
characterized as functions that support existing parts of the body. These services may 
include the procurement and fabrication of artificial limbs, aids for the blind, hearing aids, 
upper and lower extremity orthotic devices, wheelchairs, orthopedic shoes, plastic eyes, 
noses or major facial restorations, eyeglasses, automotive adaptive equipment, and major 
life support systems such as environmental controls and home dialysis units. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Accessible: A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with provisions outlined 
in the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA). 
Architectural Barriers Act (ABA): A set of standards developed to ensure that all buildings 
financed with federal funds are designed and constructed to be fully accessible to everyone. 
This law requires all construction, renovation, or leasing of sites, facilities, buildings, and 
other elements, financed with federal funds, to comply with the Architectural Barriers Act 
Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). The ABAAS replaces the Uniform Federal Accessibility 
Standards (UFAS). 
Average Length of Encounter (ALoE): Averaged length of time, in minutes, a patient spends 
in an Exam / Treatment Room interacting with a provider and the clinical support team. It is 
accounted from room “set-up” to “clean-up” by staff. This metric is used to determine the 
number of annual patient / provider encounters that take place in an Exam / Treatment 
Room which, in turn, is used to calculate the number of Exam / Treatment Rooms needed in 
a facility based on projected annual workload. The ALoE is determined with VHA SME input 
during a PG-18-9 clinical chapter revision / update. 
Average Length of Stay (ALoS): The average number of days a patient Veteran stays in an 
inpatient care unit. The ALoS is used to calculate the number of patient bedrooms for a 
specialty by dividing the site’s projected workload by the ALoS. 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS.

Clinic Stop: Per these criteria, a clinic stop is the workload unit of measure for space 
planning. Clinic Stops are codified by VSSC, when applicable, they are referenced by number 
in the calculation of workload driven patient care spaces in this document. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each

Exam Room / Treatment Room / Consultation Room / Procedure Room, spaces where a 
patient Veteran received clinical care. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department.

design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
308 – Prosthetics and Sensory Aids Service 
4 of 17 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Provider: An individual who examines, diagnoses, treats, prescribes medication, and 
manages the care of patients within his or her scope of practice as established by the 
governing body of a healthcare organization. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
Room Efficiency Factor: A factor that provides flexibility in the utilization of a room to 
account for patient delays, scheduling conflicts, and equipment maintenance. Common 
factors are in the 75% to 85% range. A room with 80% room efficiency provides a buffer to 
assume that this room would be available 20% of the time beyond the planned operational 
practices for this room. This factor may be adjusted based on the actual and/or anticipated 
operations and processes of the room/department at a particular facility. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions.

SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
Stop Code: A measure of workload including clinic stops forecasted by the Office of Policy 
and Planning (OPP) for all Strategic Planning Categories at Medical Center and Outpatient 
Clinic levels. 
Telehealth: The use of technology, such as computers and mobile devices, to manage 
healthcare remotely. It includes a variety of health care services, including but not limited to 
online support groups, online health information and self-management tools, email and 
online communication with health care providers, remote monitoring of vital signs, video, 
or online doctor visits. Depending on the concept of operations for this space, it may be 
equipped as an exam room or as a consult room with video/camera capability. 
Utilization Rate: A factor used in the calculation of a directly workload-driven room 
throughput. It represents, in a percent value, the room is idle based on the planning 
assumptions. For example, if a directly workload-driven room is available for use 8 hours a 
day, the Utilization Rate represents the assumed time it will be actually be used, an 85% 
utilization rate indicates, for planning purposes, the room will be used 6.8 hours a day. An 
additional directly workload-driven room will be provided in the calculation once the 
previous room has reached 100% utilization. The utilization Rate is embedded in the Room 
Throughput value calculated in Section 3 of this document. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
308 – Prosthetics and Sensory Aids Service 
6 of 17 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
Workstation: Area outfitted with equipment and furnishings, typically allocated 56 NSF 
each. Managers and other staff with no direct reports as well as part-time, seasonal, and 
job-sharing staff may qualify for a workstation. Such environments are particularly 
conducive to team-oriented office groupings. These environments work best when they 
have access to conference and small group meeting spaces. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space planning criteria included in this Standard have been specifically developed for 
this Department / Service in a Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare facility based 
on established VHA policy and guidelines to define the scope of services provided for 
the existing workload demand as well as that in the foreseeable future. Rooms and 
Functional Areas are provided based on research of clinical and non-clinical activities 
performed in this Department. 
B. Development / update of VA’s Program Guide (PG) standards is a research based effort 
executed with participation of VHA Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), VA-Construction and 
Facilities Management Office (CFM) professional staff and specialty consultants hired for 
the task. These space planning standards are based on current applicable VHA policies 
and guidelines, established and/or anticipated best practice standards, and latest 
medical technology developments. Workload metrics were tailored to satisfy current 
and anticipated veteran workload demand. 
C. The space planning component of PG-18-9 is based on the Space Planning Concept 
Matrix (SPCM) which lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and assigns room 
quantity (Q) and area (NSF) for a series of ranges corresponding to the smallest to the 
largest department for this service in the VA healthcare system in incremental size; each 
range corresponds to a workload parameter which determines the number and area of 
each directly workload-driven room. The remainder of the rooms in the range i.e., 
waiting, storage, staff workstations, etc. are determined by ratios to the resulting 
number of or NSF of the workload-driven rooms. 
D. Sections 4 and 5 of these space planning standards as well as the PG-18-5 standard are 
implemented in the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) and hosted at the 
MAX.gov website so planners working on VA Construction projects can develop single or 
multi-department projects based on these PG-18-9- and the PG-18-5 standards. Output 
from SEPS is through Space and Contents Reports; the Space Report is the Program for 
Design (PFD), the Content Report is the Project Room Contents (PRC). Inclusion of a 
Functional Area as well as Room quantity (Q) and determination of the room area (NSF) 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
308 – Prosthetics and Sensory Aids Service 
7 of 17 
in the PFD is based on the projected Workload input which triggers calculations included 
in the Room Criteria Statements (RCSs). The RCSs are placed immediately after each 
room name, room code and baseline area (NSF). The PRC list the medical equipment, 
furniture and fixtures associated to each Room Code in the project. The PFD & PRC are 
the baseline requirements for the planning phase of a VA project based on a site’s 
projected workload for the target planning year. This chapter’s corresponding PG-18-12, 
Design Guide -if available- is intended for use during the design phase of the project. 
E. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Prosthetics 
and Sensory Aids Service Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as the basis 
for this chapter. The Prosthetics and Sensory Aids Service SPCM lists all the spaces a VA 
Prosthetics and Sensory Aids Service site would require; the quantity and NSF for each 
room is calculated based on the Prosthetics and Sensory Aids Service projected 
workload or number of FTE positions authorized. The SPCM is organized in 10 ranges, 
each range represents an incremental workload value equivalent to one Patient Care 
Room, this way all current VA Prosthetics and Sensory Aids Service sites are covered in 
the SPCM. The upper ranges are calculated for future facilities in case a higher projected 
workload. Each range corresponds to an annual Prosthetics and Sensory Aids Service 
workload of 3,200 encounters. The 10 SPCM ranges cover between 660 -20% of 3,200- 
and 32,000 annual encounters. 
F. The SPCM metrics are translated into one (or more) Room Criteria Statement (RCS) for 
each room in Section 5 of this document. The SPCM Planning Range, the maximum 
number of directly workload-driven patient care rooms, in this document is 10. If a 
project shall require provision of workload driven rooms above the maximum range 
value refer to CFM for guidance. Rooms in this space planning document are organized 
in 5 Functional Areas (FAs). 
G. Based on its intended function, each room / space is assigned a: 
1. Room Name (RN), 
2. Room Code (RC), 
3. Room Area, the Net Square Feet (NSF) and its corresponding “soft metric” Net 
Square Meters (NSM), 
4. Unique Room Criteria Statement(s) (RCSs) correlated to answers to Input Data 
Statements (IDSs), and 
5. Room Comment as needed. 
H. The Room Codes included in this chapter stem from the VA Room Family. A unique 
support space, that may have variable area, is assigned a unique Room Code and adopts 
the square footage, as needed, correlated to the room contents assigned which in turn 
correspond to the range for those rooms. A unique clinical space or a direct clinical 
support room, i.e., control room, system components room, etc. typically does not 
feature variable NSF. Patient Care room names for rooms unique to this chapter end in 
“, Prsthtcs Svc”. Patient Care Support room names end in “, Bldg Sprt”, “Clncl Sprt”, “Stff 
Sprt”, or “, Vet Sprt”, correlating to Building, Clinical, Staff or Veteran Support room 
families.

I. Section 5, Sub-Section F lists the SEPS Importer Shortcuts used for implementation of 
Sections 4 & 5 in SEPS. These shortcuts are inserted into the Room Criteria Statement 
(RCS) for each room which upon upload into the Space and Equipment Planning System 
(SEPS) allowing planners developing VA healthcare projects to determine quantity and 
square footage of each room by performing mathematical or logical calculations. 
Shortcuts refer Input Data Statements (IDSs), Rooms or calculation parameters 
stemming from the SPCM. 
J. SEPS is accessible to government healthcare planners and private sector consultants 
working on VA HC projects during their Period of Performance (PoP) through the 
MAX.gov website; government provided Training is a requisite for access. 
K. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross factor (NTDG) factor of 1.25 for 
Prosthetics and Sensory Aids Service and a Building Gross factor of 1.35 in the space 
calculation to generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building 
Gross Square Feet (BGSF) respectively for the project based on the aggregate resulting 
Net Square Feet (NSF) for each range. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the 
NTDG factor is fixed. 
L. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-5 Equipment Guidelist for the Room Content 
assignment for each room during the planning phase of a project. 
M. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-12: Design Guide, if available, during the 
planning and design phases of a project. Not all PG-18-9 clinical chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 document, please refer to the VA-TIL. 
N. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities

6 PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. For efficiency in programming and planning combine and co-locate waiting, reception, 
and restroom functions and spaces of related services. 
B. The Prosthetic and Sensory Aids Service should be located with convenient access from 
the main entrance to the facility in order to reduce the travel distance to the service for 
disabled veterans. Direct access to Ambulatory Care and Physical Medicine and 
Rehabilitation Services is desirable. 
C. Patients requiring Prosthetic and Orthotic devices require increased maneuvering space. 
This should be taken into consideration when designing space within the service. 
D. Configure patient waiting areas to provide clustered seating in order to eliminate large 
waiting spaces, reduce noise and confusion, and improve the general patient 
environment. 
E. Patient confidentiality should be maintained when providing personal information to 
interview clerks and/or other staff. 
F. A strong relationship between Prosthetics and Sensory Aids Service, Physical Medicine 
and Rehabilitation Service and the SCI Patient Care Unit should be maintained. These 
services should be located within close proximity to each other. 
G. Locate staff areas to be convenient to staff but separate from patient areas. 
H. Refer to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management Technical Information Library (www.cfm.va.gov/til/) for additional 
technical criteria.

1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines space planning criteria for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) 
facilities providing Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Programs (MHRRTP) 
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) MHRRTP program represents that segment of the 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care continuum which provides rehabilitative 
and long-term health maintenance care for veterans who require minimal acute medical 
care. A recipient of this care is called “MHRRTP resident.” These patients do not require the 
level of clinical intervention, bedside nursing care or observation routinely provided to 
other categories of patients such as medical, psychiatric, intermediate or nursing home 
patients. They do, however, require a full range of rehabilitation services, which may 
include, as authorized: MHRRTP Care for Homeless Veterans (DCHV): Center for Addiction 
Treatment Program (CAT), Health Maintenance Program (HMP), Post-Traumatic Stress 
Disorder Residential Rehabilitation Program (PRRP), and Traumatic Brain Injury.  
MHRRTP programs provide a safe, secure, therapeutic, home-like environment designed to 
facilitate attainment of each patient’s optimal level of functional independence through 
active participation in individually developed treatment plans. MHRRTP residents typically 
possess multiple chronic medical, psychological and social problems; are economically 
disadvantaged; are currently unemployable and are limited in their ability to provide 
adequately for themselves in the community. Many fall in the category of “homeless”.  
MHRRTP care has been shown to be a clinically appropriate, cost effective alternative to the 
unwarranted utilization of scarce and more costly acute care resources in meeting the 
rehabilitative and health maintenance needs of chronic care patients. The ultimate goal of 
the MHRRTP is the return of the Veteran to independent or semi-independent life in the 
community. At the same time, it has to be recognized that there are a small proportion of 
patients who require a “sheltered environment” for an indefinite period of time. For those 
patients, the MHRRTP provides the physical, social, cultural and vocational ingredients 
necessary for them to achieve and maintain the best possible quality of life within their 
capability. 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Communications Center: The central control point for the patient unit. 
Center for Addictions Treatment (CAT): The CAT is an alcohol and drug rehabilitation 
program. Addiction services includes detoxification (1-3 days), pre-programming evaluation 
(1-14 days) and an intensive 28-day component designed to impact the veteran’s denial 
system and present the patient with an array of recovery tools. CAT also offers the 
Cornerstone Track and the Balanced Living Track to teach veterans to apply the learned 
recovery tools. 
Health Maintenance Program (HMP): This program provides health maintenance care to 
veterans with chronic medical and psychiatric problems needing long-term maintenance 
care. HMP provides assessment and quality medical care in a supportive environment to 
ADL-independent veterans who require support in the activities of daily living (ADL). Many 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
312 – Mental Health Resident Care Unit (MH RCU) 
 
3 of 27 
of these veterans are lacking financial resources and the general support necessary for 
transition back into the community. 
MHRRTP Homeless Program: MHRRTP Care for Homeless Veterans (DCHV): The DCHV is a 
vocational rehabilitation program designed to help the veteran to solve his/her 
homelessness problem by returning to income-generating productivity. This program also 
provides assistance in locating a safe, healthy and affordable living environment. DCHV staff 
assists the veteran in securing housing or alternative placement. The ultimate goal is 
returning to or achieving a move independent lifestyle.  
MHRRTP Unit: The minimum number of resident beds, of all types, to generate one 
MHRRTP Patient Care Unit is sixteen; the maximum is twenty-eight. 
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Residential Rehabilitation Program (PRRP): The PRRP is a 
structured 90-day program focused on helping veterans to move toward resolution of 
feelings associated with their experiences during the war and thereafter. The PRRP helps 
the veterans to better understand the ways traumatic experiences have affected them and 
to prepare them for successful return to community living. PRRP treatment is intended to 
facilitate continuing recovery from a variety of service-related experiences including 
trauma, homecoming and readjustment. 
Traumatic Brain Injury (Mainstream): This program provides cognitive rehabilitation to 
veterans and active duty personnel who have sustained a brain injury and to return those 
persons to the highest level of functioning possible. Mainstream provides a structured 
environment which includes life skills classes, psychosocial groups, recreation activities and 
community outings for the veterans. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Accessible: A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with provisions outlined 
in the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA). 
Architectural Barriers Act (ABA): A set of standards developed to ensure that all buildings 
financed with federal funds are designed and constructed to be fully accessible to everyone. 
This law requires all construction, renovation, or leasing of sites, facilities, buildings, and 
other elements, financed with federal funds, to comply with the Architectural Barriers Act 
Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). The ABAAS replaces the Uniform Federal Accessibility 
Standards (UFAS). 
Average Length of Encounter (ALoE): Averaged length of time, in minutes, a patient spends 
in an Exam / Treatment Room interacting with a provider and the clinical support team. It is 
accounted from room “set-up” to “clean-up” by staff. This metric is used to determine the 
number of annual patient / provider encounters that take place in an Exam / Treatment 
Room which, in turn, is used to calculate the number of Exam / Treatment Rooms needed in 
a facility based on projected annual workload. The ALoE is determined with VHA SME input 
during a PG-18-9 clinical chapter revision / update. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
312 – Mental Health Resident Care Unit (MH RCU) 
 
4 of 27 
Average Length of Stay (ALoS): The average number of days a patient Veteran stays in an 
inpatient care unit. The ALoS is used to calculate the number of patient bedrooms for a 
specialty by dividing the site’s projected workload by the ALoS. 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Clinic Stop: Per these criteria, a clinic stop is the workload unit of measure for space 
planning. Clinic Stops are codified by VSSC, when applicable, they are referenced by number 
in the calculation of workload driven patient care spaces in this document. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Encounter: An interaction between a patient Veteran and a VA provider or providers in an 
Exam Room / Treatment Room / Consultation Room / Procedure Room, spaces where a 
patient Veteran received clinical care. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
312 – Mental Health Resident Care Unit (MH RCU) 
 
5 of 27 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Patient Unique: (or Unique Patient), A Veteran patient counted as a unique in each division 
from which they receive care. Patient Uniques are included in the Registry for a VA Medical 
Center. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Provider: An individual who examines, diagnoses, treats, prescribes medication, and 
manages the care of patients within his or her scope of practice as established by the 
governing body of a healthcare organization. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
312 – Mental Health Resident Care Unit (MH RCU) 
 
6 of 27 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
Room Efficiency Factor: A factor that provides flexibility in the utilization of a room to 
account for patient delays, scheduling conflicts, and equipment maintenance. Common 
factors are in the 75% to 85% range. A room with 80% room efficiency provides a buffer to 
assume that this room would be available 20% of the time beyond the planned operational 
practices for this room. This factor may be adjusted based on the actual and/or anticipated 
operations and processes of the room/department at a particular facility. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
Stop Code: A measure of workload including clinic stops forecasted by the Office of Policy 
and Planning (OPP) for all Strategic Planning Categories at Medical Center and Outpatient 
Clinic levels. 
Telehealth: The use of technology, such as computers and mobile devices, to manage 
healthcare remotely. It includes a variety of health care services, including but not limited to 
online support groups, online health information and self-management tools, email and 
online communication with health care providers, remote monitoring of vital signs, video, 
or online doctor visits. Depending on the concept of operations for this space, it may be 
equipped as an exam room or as a consult room with video/camera capability. 
Utilization Rate: A factor used in the calculation of a directly workload-driven room 
throughput. It represents, in a percent value, the room is idle based on the planning 
assumptions. For example, if a directly workload-driven room is available for use 8 hours a 
day, the Utilization Rate represents the assumed time it will be actually be used, an 85% 
utilization rate indicates, for planning purposes, the room will be used 6.8 hours a day. An 
additional directly workload-driven room will be provided in the calculation once the 
previous room has reached 100% utilization. The utilization Rate is embedded in the Room 
Throughput value calculated in Section 3 of this document.

VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
Workstation: Area outfitted with equipment and furnishings, typically allocated 56 NSF 
each. Managers and other staff with no direct reports as well as part-time, seasonal, and 
job-sharing staff may qualify for a workstation. Such environments are particularly 
conducive to team-oriented office groupings. These environments work best when they 
have access to conference and small group meeting spaces. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space planning criteria included in this Standard have been specifically developed for 
this Department / Service in a Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare facility based 
on established VHA policy and guidelines to define the scope of services provided for 
the existing workload demand as well as that in the foreseeable future. Rooms and 
Functional Areas are provided based on research of clinical and non-clinical activities 
performed in this Department. 
B. Development / update of VA’s Program Guide (PG) standards is a research based effort 
executed with participation of VHA Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), VA-Construction and 
Facilities Management Office (CFM) professional staff and specialty consultants hired for 
the task. These space planning standards are based on current applicable VHA policies 
and guidelines, established and/or anticipated best practice standards, and latest 
medical technology developments. Workload metrics were tailored to satisfy current 
and anticipated veteran workload demand. 
C. The space planning component of PG-18-9 is based on the Space Planning Concept 
Matrix (SPCM) which lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and assigns room 
quantity (Q) and area (NSF) for a series of ranges corresponding to the smallest to the 
largest department for this service in the VA healthcare system in incremental size; each 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA March 1, 2022 
312 – Mental Health Resident Care Unit (MH RCU) 
 
8 of 27 
range corresponds to a workload parameter which determines the number and area of 
each directly workload-driven room. The remainder of the rooms in the range i.e., 
waiting, storage, staff workstations, etc. are determined by ratios to the resulting 
number of or NSF of the workload-driven rooms. 
D. Sections 4 and 5 of these space planning standards as well as the PG-18-5 standard are 
implemented in the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) and hosted at the 
MAX.gov website so planners working on VA Construction projects can develop single or 
multi-department projects based on these PG-18-9- and the PG-18-5 standards. Output 
from SEPS is through Space and Contents Reports; the Space Report is the Program for 
Design (PFD), the Content Report is the Project Room Contents (PRC). Inclusion of a 
Functional Area as well as Room quantity (Q) and determination of the room area (NSF) 
in the PFD is based on the projected Workload input which triggers calculations included 
in the Room Criteria Statements (RCSs). The RCSs are placed immediately after each 
room name, room code and baseline area (NSF). The PRC list the medical equipment, 
furniture and fixtures associated to each Room Code in the project. The PFD & PRC are 
the baseline requirements for the planning phase of a VA project based on a site’s 
projected workload for the target planning year. This chapter’s corresponding PG-18-12, 
Design Guide -if available- is intended for use during the design phase of the project. 
E. Space planning criteria herein reflect the space allocation standards for any Mental 
Health Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Program (MHRRTP) project in the VA 
System of Care, as such it is not location specific and are applicable to all VA facilities 
providing accommodation for inpatient Mental Health. 
F. Space Planning Criteria herein applies to a VA MHRRTP project range of between 16 and 
60 resident beds in increments of four resident beds. A planner developing a space 
program for a project with a requirement above or below this range shall use these 
standards as a baseline and manually adjust the Program for Design as needed with 
support of the Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM). 
G. Resident Care Units (RCUs) are sized for 16, 20, 24 and 28 resident beds. Based on these 
four RCU sizes, the total number of Resident Care Units in a project are generated per 
Table 1 below.

H. Rooms provided to support the demand generated are organized in the following 
Functional Areas (FAs): 
1. Reception Area

2. Common Resident Services Area 
3. Clinical Evaluation Area 
4. Resident Care Unit (RCU) Patient Area 
5. Resident Care Unit (RCU) Support Area 
6. Resident Care Unit (RCU) Staff Area 
7. Staff and Administrative Area, 
8. Resident Nutrition and Food Service Area, and  
9. Support Area. 
I. Room Area (NSF / NSM) and quantity (Q) of each room for every MH RCU size generated 
in the range above have been calculated in the Space Planning Criteria Concept Matrix; 
they are reflected as conditions in the Room Criteria Statement(s) (RCSs) for each room 
in Section 5. Refer to PG-18-12, Appendix X for the Space Planning Criteria Concept 
Matrix. 
J. Room Criteria Statements (RCSs) are triggered by answers to the Input Data Statements 
(IDSs) in Section 4 and generate a set of spaces whose quantity and area correspond to 
the number of Patient Beds authorized for a MH RCU project in the VA System of Care. 
K. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Mental 
Health Resident Care Unit (MH RCU) Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed 
as the basis for this chapter. The Mental Health Resident Care Unit (MH RCU) SPCM lists 
all the spaces a VA Mental Health Resident Care Unit (MH RCU) site would require; the 
quantity and NSF for each room is calculated based on the Mental Health Resident Care 
Unit (MH RCU) projected workload or number of FTE positions authorized. The SPCM is 
organized in 10 ranges, each range represents an incremental workload value equivalent 
to one Patient Care Room, this way all current VA Mental Health Resident Care Unit (MH 
RCU) sites are covered in the SPCM. The upper ranges are calculated for future facilities 
in case a higher projected workload or FTE positions authorized than those at the 
present time for Mental Health Resident Care Unit (MH RCU). 
L. The SPCM metrics are translated into one (or more) Room Criteria Statement (RCS) for 
each room in Section 5 of this document. The SPCM Planning Range, the maximum 
number of directly workload-driven patient care rooms, in this document is 10. If a 
project shall require provision of workload driven rooms above the maximum range 
value refer to CFM for guidance. Rooms in this space planning document are organized 
in 5 Functional Areas (FAs). 
M. Based on its intended function, each room / space is assigned a: 
1. Room Name (RN), 
2. Room Code (RC), 
3. Room Area, the Net Square Feet (NSF) and its corresponding “soft metric” Net 
Square Meters (NSM), 
4. Unique Room Criteria Statement(s) (RCSs) correlated to answers to Input Data 
Statements (IDSs), and 
5. Room Comment as needed.

N. The Room Codes included in this chapter stem from the VA Room Family. A unique 
support space, that may have variable area, is assigned a unique Room Code and adopts 
the square footage, as needed, correlated to the room contents assigned which in turn 
correspond to the range for those rooms. A unique clinical space or a direct clinical 
support room, i.e., control room, system components room, etc. typically does not 
feature variable NSF. Patient Care room names for rooms unique to this chapter end in 
“, MH RCU”. Patient Care Support room names end in “, Bldg Sprt”, “Clncl Sprt”, “Stff 
Sprt”, or “, Vet Sprt”, correlating to Building, Clinical, Staff or Veteran Support room 
families. 
O. Section 5, Sub-Section F lists the SEPS Importer Shortcuts used for implementation of 
Sections 4 & 5 in SEPS. These shortcuts are inserted into the Room Criteria Statement 
(RCS) for each room which upon upload into the Space and Equipment Planning System 
(SEPS) allowing planners developing VA healthcare projects to determine quantity and 
square footage of each room by performing mathematical or logical calculations. 
Shortcuts refer Input Data Statements (IDSs), Rooms or calculation parameters 
stemming from the SPCM. 
P. SEPS is accessible to government healthcare planners and private sector consultants 
working on VA HC projects during their Period of Performance (PoP) through the 
MAX.gov website; government provided Training is a requisite for access. 
Q. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross factor (NTDG) factor of 1.55 for Mental 
Health Resident Care Unit (MH RCU) and a Building Gross factor of 1.35 in the space 
calculation to generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building 
Gross Square Feet (BGSF) respectively for the project based on the aggregate resulting 
Net Square Feet (NSF) for each range. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the 
NTDG factor is fixed. 
R. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-5 Equipment Guidelist for the Room Content 
assignment for each room during the planning phase of a project. 
S. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-12: Design Guide, if available, during the 
planning and design phases of a project. Not all PG-18-9 clinical chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 document, please refer to the VA-TIL. 
T. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities

isolation concerns, patient privacy, and patient safety by minimizing patient transfers. 
C. Two-bed Patient Bedrooms are provided for patients whose mental diagnosis and 
treatment planning is better served with additional patient interaction. 
D. All patient bedrooms will have a private connecting bathroom with toilet, shower and 
lavatory. 
E. Patient corridors should be a minimum of 8’-0” wide, to accommodate wheelchairs, 
motorized scooters, or gurneys. 
F. Refer to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Facilities Management 
Handbooks, Standards, Standard Details, and Design Guides for technical criteria. 
G. If the VA facility has recreation space dedicated for use, the need for the recreation 
multipurpose room, physical exercise and arts and crafts areas must be evaluated. 
H. The exercise and arts and crafts programs will be managed by kinesiotherapists and 
occupational therapist during the day-time but will be available for use by individual 
patients or other disciplines during evening hours. See Design Guide for additional 
details.

2 of 21 
1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines Space Planning Criteria for Chapter 316: Dialysis Center. It applies to 
all medical facilities at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Bariatrics: The branch of medicine which deals with the causes, prevention, and treatment 
of obesity. The Dialysis Center must accommodate, in its equipment and design, a high 
percentage of bariatric patients, many of whom are disabled or non-ambulatory. 
Dialysate: A solution of water and chemicals used in dialysis. Dialysate shall be provided in 
both single-patient and multiple-patient mixtures as determined by the medical staff. 
Dialysis: A type of renal replacement therapy which is used to provide an artificial 
replacement for lost kidney functions. There are two main forms of dialysis, Hemodialysis 
and Peritoneal Dialysis, both of which are life support treatments; but dialysis does not 
treat kidney diseases. Dialysis may be used for very sick patients who have recently lost 
kidney functions (acute renal failure) or for stable patients who have permanently lost 
kidney functions (chronic or end-stage renal failure). 
Dialysis Center: A highly specialized program which provides facilities for the treatment of 
patients with irreversible renal insufficiencies. Treatment procedures require professional 
supervision by staff experienced in renal pathophysiology. The Dialysis Center may serve 
either or both inpatients and outpatients, depending upon the medical facility type, and 
may provide self-dialysis training for Peritoneal Dialysis in addition to on-site assisted 
dialysis, i.e., Hemodialysis. The Dialysis Center administers both single-patient and multipatient
Hemodialysis systems. 
Hemodialysis (also Haemodialysis): The form of renal dialysis typically conducted in a 
Dialysis Center. Hemodialysis relies on convective transport of a dialysate and utilizes 
counter-current flow, where the dialysate is flowing in the opposite direction to blood flow 
in an extracorporeal circuit. 
Pathophysiology: The study of the disturbance of normal mechanical, physical, and 
biochemical functions which a disease causes or which cause a disease. 
Peritoneal Dialysis (PD): A form of renal dialysis typically done in the patient's home and/or 
workplace. PD is based on the principle that the peritoneal membrane which surrounds the 
intestine can act as a natural semi permeable membrane and that, if a dialysate is instilled 
within the membrane through a catheter, intracorporeal dialysis can occur by diffusion. 
Water Treatment: Dialysis water treatment implies various levels of pre-treatment and a 
final purification module prior to distribution of purified water through a hydraulic circuit. 
A. Deionization (DI) Water: Water which has been treated to remove contaminants. This 
system removes most mineral deposits, but microbial contaminants may remain. 
B. Feed Water: The untreated, potable water available throughout the facility through 
its water supply system. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
316 – Dialysis Center 
3 of 21 
C. Permeate Water: Fully treated purified water, stored in a tank, which is used in the 
preparation of dialysate. 
D. Pre-treated Water: Partially treated water, sometimes available as feed water, which 
has had substantial reduction of mineral and/or microbial particles. 
E. Reverse Osmosis (RO) Water: Usually the final purification module in the treatment 
system, RO-based treatment modules produce water of optimal chemical and 
microbial quality. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Accessible: A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with provisions outlined 
in the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA). 
Architectural Barriers Act (ABA): A set of standards developed to ensure that all buildings 
financed with federal funds are designed and constructed to be fully accessible to everyone. 
This law requires all construction, renovation, or leasing of sites, facilities, buildings, and 
other elements, financed with federal funds, to comply with the Architectural Barriers Act 
Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). The ABAAS replaces the Uniform Federal Accessibility 
Standards (UFAS). 
Average Length of Encounter (ALoE): Averaged length of time, in minutes, a patient spends 
in an Exam / Treatment Room interacting with a provider and the clinical support team. It is 
accounted from room “set-up” to “clean-up” by staff. This metric is used to determine the 
number of annual patient / provider encounters that take place in an Exam / Treatment 
Room which, in turn, is used to calculate the number of Exam / Treatment Rooms needed in 
a facility based on projected annual workload. The ALoE is determined with VHA SME input 
during a PG-18-9 clinical chapter revision / update. 
Average Length of Stay (ALoS): The average number of days a patient Veteran stays in an 
inpatient care unit. The ALoS is used to calculate the number of patient bedrooms for a 
specialty by dividing the site’s projected workload by the ALoS. 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Clinic Stop: Per these criteria, a clinic stop is the workload unit of measure for space 
planning. Clinic Stops are codified by VSSC, when applicable, they are referenced by number 
in the calculation of workload driven patient care spaces in this document. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022

Encounter: An interaction between a patient Veteran and a VA provider or providers in an 
Exam Room / Treatment Room / Consultation Room / Procedure Room, spaces where a 
patient Veteran received clinical care. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Patient Unique: (or Unique Patient), A Veteran patient counted as a unique in each division 
from which they receive care. Patient Uniques are included in the Registry for a VA Medical 
Center. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
316 – Dialysis Center 
5 of 21 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Provider: An individual who examines, diagnoses, treats, prescribes medication, and 
manages the care of patients within his or her scope of practice as established by the 
governing body of a healthcare organization. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
Room Efficiency Factor: A factor that provides flexibility in the utilization of a room to 
account for patient delays, scheduling conflicts, and equipment maintenance. Common 
factors are in the 75% to 85% range. A room with 80% room efficiency provides a buffer to 
assume that this room would be available 20% of the time beyond the planned operational 
practices for this room. This factor may be adjusted based on the actual and/or anticipated 
operations and processes of the room/department at a particular facility. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section.

316 – Dialysis Center 
6 of 21 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
Stop Code: A measure of workload including clinic stops forecasted by the Office of Policy 
and Planning (OPP) for all Strategic Planning Categories at Medical Center and Outpatient 
Clinic levels. 
Telehealth: The use of technology, such as computers and mobile devices, to manage 
healthcare remotely. It includes a variety of health care services, including but not limited to 
online support groups, online health information and self-management tools, email and 
online communication with health care providers, remote monitoring of vital signs, video, 
or online doctor visits. Depending on the concept of operations for this space, it may be 
equipped as an exam room or as a consult room with video/camera capability. 
Utilization Rate: A factor used in the calculation of a directly workload-driven room 
throughput. It represents, in a percent value, the room is idle based on the planning 
assumptions. For example, if a directly workload-driven room is available for use 8 hours a 
day, the Utilization Rate represents the assumed time it will be actually be used, an 85% 
utilization rate indicates, for planning purposes, the room will be used 6.8 hours a day. An 
additional directly workload-driven room will be provided in the calculation once the 
previous room has reached 100% utilization. The utilization Rate is embedded in the Room 
Throughput value calculated in Section 3 of this document. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality.

Workstation: Area outfitted with equipment and furnishings, typically allocated 56 NSF 
each. Managers and other staff with no direct reports as well as part-time, seasonal, and 
job-sharing staff may qualify for a workstation. Such environments are particularly 
conducive to team-oriented office groupings. These environments work best when they 
have access to conference and small group meeting spaces. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space planning criteria included in this Standard have been specifically developed for 
this Department / Service in a Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare facility based 
on established VHA policy and guidelines to define the scope of services provided for 
the existing workload demand as well as that in the foreseeable future. Rooms and 
Functional Areas are provided based on research of clinical and non-clinical activities 
performed in this Department. 
B. Development / update of VA’s Program Guide (PG) standards is a research based effort 
executed with participation of VHA Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), VA-Construction and 
Facilities Management Office (CFM) professional staff and specialty consultants hired for 
the task. These space planning standards are based on current applicable VHA policies 
and guidelines, established and/or anticipated best practice standards, and latest 
medical technology developments. Workload metrics were tailored to satisfy current 
and anticipated veteran workload demand. 
C. The space planning component of PG-18-9 is based on the Space Planning Concept 
Matrix (SPCM) which lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and assigns room 
quantity (Q) and area (NSF) for a series of ranges corresponding to the smallest to the 
largest department for this service in the VA healthcare system in incremental size; each 
range corresponds to a workload parameter which determines the number and area of 
each directly workload-driven room. The remainder of the rooms in the range i.e., 
waiting, storage, staff workstations, etc. are determined by ratios to the resulting 
number of or NSF of the workload-driven rooms. 
D. Sections 4 and 5 of these space planning standards as well as the PG-18-5 standard are 
implemented in the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) and hosted at the 
MAX.gov website so planners working on VA Construction projects can develop single or 
multi-department projects based on these PG-18-9- and the PG-18-5 standards. Output 
from SEPS is through Space and Contents Reports; the Space Report is the Program for 
Design (PFD), the Content Report is the Project Room Contents (PRC). Inclusion of a 
Functional Area as well as Room quantity (Q) and determination of the room area (NSF) 
in the PFD is based on the projected Workload input which triggers calculations included 
in the Room Criteria Statements (RCSs). The RCSs are placed immediately after each 
room name, room code and baseline area (NSF). The PRC list the medical equipment, 
furniture and fixtures associated to each Room Code in the project. The PFD & PRC are 
the baseline requirements for the planning phase of a VA project based on a site’s 
projected workload for the target planning year. This chapter’s corresponding PG-18-12, 
Design Guide -if available- is intended for use during the design phase of the project. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
316 – Dialysis Center 
8 of 21 
E. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Dialysis 
Center Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as the basis for this chapter. 
The Dialysis Center SPCM lists all the spaces a VA Dialysis Center site would require; the 
quantity and NSF for each room is calculated based on the Dialysis Center projected 
workload or number of FTE positions authorized. The SPCM is organized in 22 ranges, 
each range represents an incremental workload value equivalent an averaged annual 
Dialysis Station throughput of 530 encounters, covering a range of 94 to 11,660 annual 
encounters, this way all current VA Dialysis Center sites are covered in the SPCM. The 
upper ranges are calculated for future facilities in case a higher projected workload. 
F. The SPCM metrics are translated into one (or more) Room Criteria Statement (RCS) for 
each room in Section 5 of this document. The SPCM Planning Range, the maximum 
number of directly workload-driven patient care rooms, in this document is 10. If a 
project shall require provision of workload driven rooms above the maximum range 
value refer to CFM for guidance. Rooms in this space planning document are organized 
in 5 Functional Areas (FAs). 
G. Based on its intended function, each room / space is assigned a: 
1. Room Name (RN), 
2. Room Code (RC), 
3. Room Area, the Net Square Feet (NSF) and its corresponding “soft metric” Net 
Square Meters (NSM), 
4. Unique Room Criteria Statement(s) (RCSs) correlated to answers to Input Data 
Statements (IDSs), and 
5. Room Comment as needed. 
H. The Room Codes included in this chapter stem from the VA Room Family. A unique 
support space, that may have variable area, is assigned a unique Room Code and adopts 
the square footage, as needed, correlated to the room contents assigned which in turn 
correspond to the range for those rooms. A unique clinical space or a direct clinical 
support room, i.e., control room, system components room, etc. typically does not 
feature variable NSF. Patient Care room names for rooms unique to this chapter end in 
“, Dlsys Ctr”. Patient Care Support room names end in “, Bldg Sprt”, “Clncl Sprt”, “Stff 
Sprt”, or “, Vet Sprt”, correlating to Building, Clinical, Staff or Veteran Support room 
families. 
I. Section 5, Sub-Section F lists the SEPS Importer Shortcuts used for implementation of 
Sections 4 & 5 in SEPS. These shortcuts are inserted into the Room Criteria Statement 
(RCS) for each room which upon upload into the Space and Equipment Planning System 
(SEPS) allowing planners developing VA healthcare projects to determine quantity and 
square footage of each room by performing mathematical or logical calculations. 
Shortcuts refer Input Data Statements (IDSs), Rooms or calculation parameters 
stemming from the SPCM.

J. SEPS is accessible to government healthcare planners and private sector consultants 
working on VA HC projects during their Period of Performance (PoP) through the 
MAX.gov website; government provided Training is a requisite for access. 
K. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross factor (NTDG) factor of 1.50 for Dialysis 
Center and a Building Gross factor of 1.35 in the space calculation to generate the 
Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross Square Feet (BGSF) 
respectively for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet (NSF) for 
each range. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the NTDG factor is fixed. 
L. Refer to the chapter corresponding PG-18-5 Equipment Guidelist for the Room Content

F. SEPS IMPORTER SHORTCUTS 
The following shortcuts are used in the Room Criteria Statements in the Dialysis Center 
Functional Areas. These shortcuts are used during upload of this document into the 
Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) software during implementation of the 
space planning parameters contained herewith to allow for mathematical or logical 
calculations to be performed. Input Data Statements (IDSs), Rooms or a partial 
calculation formula can have a shortcut. 
1. number of Dialysis Stations: [Chair Station Cubicle, Dlsys Ctr (CDL05)] + [Bed Station 
Cubicle, Dlsys Ctr (CDL07)] + [Bed Station, Dlsys Ctr (CDL01)] + [Isolation Negative 
Pressure Bed Station, Dlsys Ctr (CDL03)] 
2. Renal Dialysis Center Clinic stops projected: [How many annual Renal Dialysis Center 
Clinic stops are projected?] 
6 PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. Outpatients shall have convenient access to the Dialysis Center from parking areas and 
public transportation. Inpatients should have a secluded access which accommodates 
the passage of bariatric size patient transport devices. 
B. The Nurse Station(s) must have a clear visual line of observation of each patient station 
and each patient toilet room entrance. Each Nurse Station shall observe no more than 
ten patient stations; and, when multiple Nurse Stations are required, they shall be 
arranged to each observe as equal a share of the Dialysis Stations as possible. 
C. Dialysis patients are highly susceptible to infections. Set the Dialysis Center in an area 
which will prevent cross-flow by other patients and staff; provide strategically placed 
and accessible hand washing stations throughout the patient treatment areas; and 
locate each dialysate return receptacle on the wall, centered at each patient station, 
and at a height such that it is easily accessible to clean repeatedly each day. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022

19 of 21 
D. Provide 4’-0” (1.22m) minimum clearance between beds or chairs and a headwall at 
each Dialysis Station at least 10’-9” (3.28m) wide. 
E. The height of the dialysate receptacle shall be coordinated with the equipment and the 
preceding parameter to inhibit an excessively long dialysate return hose; and any 
architectural systems used to conceal the gravity drain must be easily removable such as 
not to impede decontamination or modifications. 
F. Dialysis patients are highly sensitive to and adversely affected by unsteady ranges of 
temperature, pressure, and humidity. Environmental systems must provide stable, 
consistent conditions. 
G. If the Dialysis Center Biochemistry Laboratory is not authorized, the blood and urine 
analyses must be performed by the Clinical Laboratory of the Medical Facility, and 
proximity must be considered as shown in the Functional Relationships Matrix below. 
H. If the Dialysis Center Biochemistry Laboratory is authorized, locate patient toilets 
adjacent to the lab, and provide a pass-through into the lab. 
I. Patient confidentiality must be maintained when providing personal information to 
interview clerks and/or other staff. The physical design of the space shall not encumber 
this requirement. 
J. Locate staff areas to be convenient to staff and separate from patient areas, and 
segregate patient and staff circulations. Since the Dialysis Center operates 24 hours a 
day / 365 days a year, its Staff Lounge, Staff Lockers, Staff Toilets, and Staff Showers 
should not be collocated with those of adjacent departments unless they are in close 
proximity and always accessible to the Dialysis Center staff. 
K. Dialysis equipment may connect directly into patient data information systems to input 
recordings of the treatment process. The designer must coordinate the interface of the 
equipment and the information system. 
L. Refer to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management Technical Information Library (www.cfm.va.gov/til/) for additional 
technical criteria.

400 – Library Service 
3 of 15 
Patient Education Resource Center (PERC): A space used by patients, their families, and 
health care facility staff to access consumer health information. If the PERC is managed by 
Services other than Library, there should be a strong liaison/coordination between the PERC 
and Library Service. 
Patient Library: A facility that provides therapeutic recreational and educational materials 
to patients and their families and may also be used by facility staff for personal growth and 
development. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning system (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
400 – Library Service 
4 of 15 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements, and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
400 – Library Service 
5 of 15 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Library 
Service Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as a basis for this chapter. The 
SPCM lists all the spaces a VA Library Service site would require; the quantity and NSF 
for each room is calculated based on the facility number of Health Care Delivery / 
Support (HCD/S) staff Level authorized organized in four ranges. 
B. The room quantity (Q) and area (NSF) values included for each range in the SPCM are 
reflected in the Room Criteria Statements, placed immediately below each room name, 
room code and NSF/NSM, for each room in Section 5 of this document. The number of 
Health Care Delivery / Support (HCD/S) staff Level is included in the Input Data 
Statements (IDSs) in Section 4. Both Sections are implemented in the Space Planning 
and Equipment System (SEPS) software accessible through the MAX.gov website. 
Planners programming a VA Library Service project shall develop a baseline Program for 
Design (PFD) in SEPS. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022

6 of 15 
C. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross (NTDG) factor of 1.20 for Library Service 
and a Building Gross (BG) factor of 1.35 in the space calculation. These factors generate 
the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross Square Feet (BGSF) for 
the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet (NSF) for all Departments 
included. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the NTDG factor is fixed. 
D. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website.

6 PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. The PERC / Patient Library should be adjacent to the Health Science Library. This permits 
staff access to both through a common circulation area. 
B. In order to achieve maximum control over the resources of the library, there should be 
one single point of entry and exit from each library. The Circulation Desk Area should be 
located at the entrance / exit, in order to provide visual as well as mechanical / 
electronic control. Where feasible, consideration should be given to one entrance to 
both libraries with a common circulation desk. 
C. The card catalog or electronic access to Card Catalogue should be seen directly upon 
entering the library and in proximity to the Circulation Desk. 
D. Current periodicals are in high demand and should be housed relatively close to the 
entrance of the library and be easily identifiable. The current periodicals should be 
contiguous to the bound periodical collection. 
E. Most material to be copied will come from the current or bound periodical collections, 
so the Photocopy Area should be close or contiguous to both. The Photocopy Area 
should be a three-sided space with heavy sound attenuation. This area also needs to 
include space or a cabinet to hold copier paper and a work area for tools such as 
staplers. 
F. Light levels in the Microform Area should be rheostatically controlled. Windows should 
be eliminated from this area. 
G. Library seating should be arranged in a manner that offers seating options close to each 
of the collection areas. 
H. The Audiovisual Room should be in visual contact with the circulation desk and adjacent 
to the Media Conference Room. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
400 – Library Service 
14 of 15 
I. The Media Conference Room and Computer Training Room will require special 
acoustical treatment to isolate noise from other areas of the library. 
J. The Workroom / Technical Services Area location should provide access to the librarian 
who supervises the technical processing activities. It should also be located between the 
two libraries for easy access by the library staff. 
K. The ideal location for the Chief, Library Service's Office is contiguous to the Circulation 
Desk and the Workroom / Technical Services Area. 
L. The Clerical Space should be immediately adjacent to the Chief, Library Service's Office 
and close to the Circulation Desk. 
M. Computers and printers will require special wiring needs and telecommunication ports. 
N. Shelving should be at least 18 inches below the ceiling to meet fire code standards. 
Consideration should be given to the impact which compact shelving has upon the 
floor’s weight bearing tolerance. 
O. Aisles, carrels, and doorways should meet Americans with Disabilities Act requirements. 
P. Refer to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management Technical Information Library (www.cfm.va.gov/til/) for additional 
technical criteria.

1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines Space Planning Criteria for Chapter 402: Educational Facilities. It 
applies to all medical facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
This chapter describes space for the facility Educational Program. This includes 
administration, large conferencing areas such as auditoriums, specialized education space 
such as simulation areas and demonstration and computer classrooms, satellite reception 
and other centralized educational facilities. Educational facilities described in this chapter 
are not otherwise accounted for in the separate departmental chapters. 
Space planning criteria for educational facilities within the Clinical, Clinical Support, and 
Administrative Support Chapters (NAMES of the 3 Types of chapter grouping here) are 
generally provided at the departmental (chapter) level. Each separate chapter has a 
functional area for education which includes space for offices, workspaces, workrooms, 
team rooms, classrooms, and conference areas. This space will be utilized by employees, 
departmental educational staff, and administrative and clinical trainees. 
Guidance for Planners: Provide clinical, departmental educational space either at the 
departmental (chapter) level or alternatively in this chapter. Do not duplicate space. 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Accredited Educational Programs for Trainees: 
A. Medical/ Dental Programs: Healthcare academic programs in allopathic and 
osteopathic medicine or dentistry. 
B. Associated Health Education Programs: Educational programs other than 
allopathic and osteopathic medicine and dentistry. 
C. Non-clinical Programs: Programs in which trainees are not involved directly 
with patient care but may train in patient care areas and have incidental 
patient contact. 
Educational Facilities: A variety of space configurations for employee or trainee education. 
These are designed to provide for a variety of training modalities such as face- to-face 
conferences, workgroup sessions, demonstrations/simulations, clinical care with trainees 
present, satellite broadcasts, V-Tel, single or multiple computer workstations configured to 
receive web-based training and CDN (Content Distribution Network). 
House staff (residents): Graduate physicians who are following accredited training programs 
leading to competence or specialization in a particular field. The term “residents” includes 
lower level residents such as interns, and higher level residents such as fellows. 
MTOT: Acronym for Maximum Number of Trainees Typically on Duty at one Time. The 
number of clinical trainees being instructed in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) 
medical center at the same time. 
Trainees: A general term to describe all undergraduate, graduate, and advanced students, 
interns, residents, fellows, and VA special fellows; at a variety of pre- and post-

baccalaureate and pre- and post- doctoral levels who spend all or part of their clinical 
training time at VA facilities. Some trainees may also rotate in non-clinical training areas. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning system (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard.

PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section.

Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Educational 
Facilities Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as a basis for this chapter. 
The SPCM lists all the spaces a VA Educational Facilities site would require; the quantity 
and NSF for each room is calculated based on total number of FTE positions authorized 
for the facility organized in five ranges each corresponding to 400 FTE positions 
authorized incrementally. 
B. The room quantity (Q) and area (NSF) values included for each range in the SPCM are 
reflected in the Room Criteria Statements, placed immediately below each room name, 
room code and NSF/NSM, for each room in Section 5 of this document. The number of 
FTE positions authorized for the facility is included in the Input Data Statements (IDSs) in 
Section 4. Both Sections are implemented in the Space Planning and Equipment System 
(SEPS) software accessible through the MAX.gov website. Planners programming a VA 
Educational Facilities project shall develop a baseline Program for Design (PFD) in SEPS. 
C. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross (NTDG) factor of 1.30 for Educational 
Facilities and a Building Gross (BG) factor of 1.35 in the space calculation. These factors 
generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross Square Feet 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
402 – Educational Facilities 
6 of 14 
(BGSF) for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet (NSF) for all 
Departments included. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the NTDG factor is 
fixed. 
D. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website.

6 PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. Space shall be configured and available to provide for both individual and interactive 
group education. 
B. Space to contain the basic computer / software configuration to host satellite 
broadcasts, video to the desk-top, V-tel, and web-based learning. 
C. Space to be provided away from individual work-stations so employees can have 
uninterrupted time devoted to education. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
402 – Educational Facilities 
12 of 14 
D. Clinical trainees, such as physician residents on inpatient rotations, who are involved in 
direct patient care, to have workrooms configured to support all types of education and 
defined medical and information technology to support the treatment of patients. This 
space should be in close proximity to patient care areas (i.e., in or near the assigned 
inpatient units or wards). Each assigned resident should have sufficient space to 
accommodate a computer work-station. 
E. Space to be provided in close proximity to other designated educational personnel such 
as in Library and Medical Media to allow for professional guidance. Refer to Chapter 
400: Library Service; and Chapter 248: Medical Media Service. 
F. Space to be provided should be integrated and flexible to allow for multi-staff use, to 
accommodate individual or group educational activities in a variety of capacities. The 
range of capacities should be designed for maximum efficiency and effectiveness. 
G. Space for educational activities must be flexible and available throughout the facility to 
provide multiple options for all employees. 
H. Physician residents and other clinical trainees who are required to take in-hospital “call” 
must be provided with suitable on call sleeping quarters and other appropriate space 
(e.g., bathrooms with showers, eating facilities) within proximity to the sleeping 
quarters and within the hospital. On call space to be assigned must include space for 
computer terminals or workstations. See Chapter 98: Quarters On Call. 
I. Clinical areas in which trainees are normally present along with supervising or attending 
practitioners should be designed to accommodate more than one practitioner, while 
taking into account the need for patient privacy. Such areas may include procedure 
rooms, operating rooms, or clinic exam rooms, in which teaching occurs in conjunction 
with the provision of clinical care on a regular basis. In most clinical areas, team rooms 
are required to facilitate the supervision of trainees while ensuring the confidentiality of 
patient information. 
J. Refer to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management Technical Information Library (www.cfm.va.gov/til/) for additional 
technical criteria.

2 of 9 
1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines space planning criteria for Chapter 406: Environmental 
Management Services Administration. It applies to all medical facilities at the Department 
of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Environmental Management Service Administration: EMS Administration includes office / 
workspace, storage and linen handling areas, housekeeping closets, and laundry. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning system (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
406 – Environmental Management Service (EMS) Administration 
3 of 9 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
406 – Environmental Management Service (EMS) Administration 
4 of 9 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the EMS 
Administration Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as a basis for this 
chapter. The SPCM lists all the spaces a VA EMS Administration site would require; the 
quantity and NSF for each room is calculated based on estimated Project Level for the 
facility organized in five ranges each corresponding to 100 patient beds incrementally. 
B. The room quantity (Q) and area (NSF) values included for each range in the SPCM are 
reflected in the Room Criteria Statements, placed immediately below each room name, 
room code and NSF/NSM, for each room in Section 5 of this document. The facility EMS 
Project Level is included in the Input Data Statements (IDSs) in Section 4. Both Sections 
are implemented in the Space Planning and Equipment System (SEPS) software 
accessible through the MAX.gov website. Planners programming a VA EMS 
Administration project shall develop a baseline Program for Design (PFD) in SEPS.

C. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross (NTDG) factor of 1.20 for EMS 
Administration and a Building Gross (BG) factor of 1.35 in the space calculation. These 
factors generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross 
Square Feet (BGSF) for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet 
(NSF) for all Departments included. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the 
NTDG factor is fixed. 
D. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website. 
E. These criteria are based on the net square footage in each facility requiring daily 
housekeeping. 
F. Space planning is based on the number of FTE’s required to perform daily cleaning 
activities. Assume that an FTE can clean approximately 14,000 NSF per shift. 
G. Support space requirements are based on supplies and the number and types of 
equipment to be stored.

408 – Environmental Management Service (EMS) Laundry and Linen Operation 
2 of 12 
1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines the Space Planning Criteria for Chapter 408: Environmental 
Management Service Laundry and Linen Operation. It applies to all medical facilities at the 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that maintain a laundry operation. 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Linen Pounds per Patient Day (PPD): The average number of pounds of soiled linen that is 
generated per patient per day. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning system (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
408 – Environmental Management Service (EMS) Laundry and Linen Operation 
3 of 12 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
408 – Environmental Management Service (EMS) Laundry and Linen Operation 
4 of 12 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the EMS Laundry 
& Linen Operation Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as a basis for this 
chapter. The SPCM lists all the spaces a VA EMS Laundry & Linen Operation site would 
require; the quantity and NSF for each room is calculated based on the number of 
patient and resident bedrooms in the facility five ranges each corresponding to 100 
patient and resident bedrooms incrementally. 
B. The room quantity (Q) and area (NSF) values included for each range in the SPCM are 
reflected in the Room Criteria Statements, placed immediately below each room name, 
room code and NSF/NSM, for each room in Section 5 of this document. The number of 
facility patient and resident bedrooms is included in the Input Data Statements (IDSs) in 
Section 4. Both Sections are implemented in the Space Planning and Equipment System 
(SEPS) software accessible through the MAX.gov website. Planners programming a VA 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
408 – Environmental Management Service (EMS) Laundry and Linen Operation 
5 of 12 
EMS Laundry & Linen Operation project shall develop a baseline Program for Design 
(PFD) in SEPS. 
C. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross (NTDG) factor of 1.15 for EMS Laundry & 
Linen Operation and a Building Gross (BG) factor of 1.35 in the space calculation. These 
factors generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross 
Square Feet (BGSF) for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet 
(NSF) for all Departments included. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the 
NTDG factor is fixed. 
D. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website. 
E. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) laundry is responsible for providing an 
adequate, constant, and clean supply of linen to all users. The basic tasks include 
sorting, weighing, washing, ironing, tumbling (drying), folding, mending, marking, and 
delivery. The laundry is usually responsible for the preparation of surgical linen packs 
that involves the inspection of linen, mending, fabrication of specialized linen items, and 
the make-up of the linen packs. As a part of the Patient Assistance Program, patient 
clothing is washed processed through the laundry. 
F. Environmental Management Service calculates linen processing quantities based on the 
average pounds of soiled linen generated per patient day. Site-specific historical data is 
utilized to calculate the number of pounds per bed by category per day (365). These 
figures are than multiplied by the number of projected beds in order to obtain the 
estimated annual pounds of linen. 
G. Similar calculations must be performed to obtain the annual poundage for the 
miscellaneous categories of linen, for example: administration, clinics. 
Assume the following soiled linen quantities per bed per day (PB/PD): 
General Hospitals: 18 pounds 
Teaching Hospitals: 20 pounds  
Psychiatric Hospitals: 12 pounds  
Nursing Homes: 8 pounds 
Annual pounds are the number of pounds/kilograms of soiled linen generated by the 
facility (medical center) for 365 days or the number of pounds/kilograms processed by 
the laundry based on 260 days of operation per year. 
Laundries operate 5 days per week for 8 hours per day. Average equipment operating 
time is 5 days per week for 7 hours per day or 1,820 hours per year.

6 PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. Laundries are classified as either individual or consolidated. The individual laundry 
provides service only to the medical center where it is located. The laundry can be 
constructed as part of the medical center structure or can be separate building. The 
consolidated laundry serves more than one medical center. It is not essential for 
consolidated laundries to be located at a medical center site. 
B. Linen carts are approximately 2’-6”w x 5’-0” l x 5’-0” h. They hold approximately 60 
cubic feet of linen. One cubic foot of clean linen weighs approximately 8 pounds. One 
cubic foot of soiled linen weighs approximately 10 pounds. 
C. Refer to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management Technical Information Library (www.cfm.va.gov/til/) for additional 
technical criteria.

1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines the Space Planning Criteria for Chapter 410: Environmental 
Management Services Administration Lockers, Lounges, Toilets, and Showers. It applies to 
all medical facilities at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
Space planning criteria for lockers, lounges, toilets and showers (LLTS) are generally 
provided at the departmental (chapter) level, in each separate chapter. Lockers, lounges, 
toilets and showers, (LLTS) which are provided in this chapter, are for all hospital staff not 
otherwise accounted for in separate departmental chapters. The facilities to be provided by 
these criteria are further defined as follows: 
Lockers: The space required to accommodate lockers for employee's clothing, or other 
personal effects, benches, dressing and circulation. 
Lounges: This space will be utilized by employees for a brief rest, relaxation or emergencies 
that require off the job environment for a degree of privacy and personal attention. 
Toilets: Toilet facilities include all water closets, urinals, and lavatories throughout the 
hospital for staff and trainees specifically designated as toilet or toilet and shower rooms. 
Showers: Shower facilities include all employee showers other than those excluded above. 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Lockers, Lounges, Toilets and Showers (LLTS): As described in these criteria, LLTS are central 
facilities for hospital support staff. Lockers, Lounges, and Toilet facilities for medical 
providers are provided in their respective chapters. 
Lockers: The space required is to accommodate lockers for employee's clothing, or other 
personal effects, benches, dressing and circulation. 
Lounges: This space will be utilized by employees for a brief rest, relaxation or emergencies 
that require off the job environment for a degree of privacy and personal attention. A 
counter nourishment station should be provided. 
Showers: Shower facilities include employee showers other than those located in specified 
departments. 
Toilets: Toilet facilities include all water closets, urinals, and sinks for support staff and 
trainees specifically designated as toilet or toilet and shower rooms. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS.

3 of 9 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning system (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs.

PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
410 – Environmental Management Service (EMS) Lockers, Lounges, Toilets and Showers 
5 of 9 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the EMS Lockers, 
Lounges, Toilets and Showers Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as a 
basis for this chapter. The SPCM lists all the spaces a VA EMS Lockers, Lounges, Toilets 
and Showers site would require; the quantity and NSF for each room is calculated based 
on the number of EMS FTE positions authorized organized in four ranges each 
corresponding to 100 FTE positions each incrementally. 
B. The room quantity (Q) and area (NSF) values included for each range in the SPCM are 
reflected in the Room Criteria Statements, placed immediately below each room name, 
room code and NSF/NSM, for each room in Section 5 of this document. The number of 
EMS FTE positions authorized is included in the Input Data Statements (IDSs) in Section 
4. Both Sections are implemented in the Space Planning and Equipment System (SEPS) 
software accessible through the MAX.gov website. Planners programming a VA EMS 
Lockers, Lounges, Toilets and Showers project shall develop a baseline Program for 
Design (PFD) in SEPS. 
C. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross (NTDG) factor of 1.20 for EMS Lockers, 
Lounges, Toilets and Showers and a Building Gross (BG) factor of 1.35 in the space 
calculation. These factors generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the 
Building Gross Square Feet (BGSF) for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net 
Square Feet (NSF) for all Departments included. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in 
SEPS; the NTDG factor is fixed. 
D. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website. 
E. The quantity of lockers, toilets and showers required are determined by the number of 
projected FTE positions authorized to be served, which are not otherwise 
accommodated in individual departments (chapters) Most Certain departments include 
programming of LLTS within each chapter. These facilities should not be duplicated.

6 PLANNING AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
A. Generally, Lockers, Lounges, Toilets, and Shower facilities are programmed and located 
in each department. LLTS programmed in this chapter should be located centrally in the 
facility so that personnel have easy and direct access from their assigned activity 
location. Lockers, Toilets and Showers will be sized and separated, Male and Female, 
based on the staff ratios. 
B. The provision of lockers for designated employees and trainees is based on the need for 
an individual secured storage space for a change in clothing and other personal 
belongings. A locker size of 12” x 21” (305 mm x 533 mm). 
C. The ratio of water closets, lavatories and urinals is based on FTEs, building codes and 
other guidelines. 
D. The lounge should accommodate both male and female employees. Access from the 
lounge to both the male and the female locker rooms and toilet rooms via a vestibule is 
desirable. Also, access from the lounge to both the main access corridor and a separate 
entrance to the toilet-locker room vestibule from the main access corridor is desirable. 
E. Refer to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Construction and Facilities

2 of 12 
1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This document outlines Space Planning Criteria for Chapter 420: Childcare Development 
Center. It applies to all medical facilities at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
Childcare/Development Centers include care for the following age groups: 
A. Infants: 6 to 26 weeks 
B. Pre-toddler: 6 to 18 months 
C. Toddler: 18 months to 3 years 
D. Preschool: 3 to 5 years 
E. School Age: 6 to 10 years 
2 DEFINITIONS 
Childcare Development Center Guidelines: All Childcare Centers must meet, as a minimum, 
state licensing requirements. All design elements must be scaled in accordance with child 
anthropometric (developmental) references. 
Childcare Area: Typical Childcare Areas are Child Activity Areas, Functional Support and Crib 
area for infants and pre-toddlers. 
Space Planning / SEPS 
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS. 
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area. 
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A staffing parameter equal to the amount of time assigned to 
one full time employee. It may be composed of several part-time employees whose 
combined time commitment equals that of one full-time employee (i.e., 40 hours per 
week). 
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department. 
Functional Area Criteria Statement (FACS): A verbalized mathematical / logical formulation 
assigned to a FA incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to determine the 
condition for providing the rooms / spaces listed in the FA in the baseline space program or 
Program for Design (PFD) for a project. Certain rooms / spaces may or may not have 
additional conditions. 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
420 – Childcare Development Center 
3 of 12 
Input Data Statement(s): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information about 
the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the parameters set 
forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through mathematical and 
logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning system (SEPS). 
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table. 
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries. 
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard. 
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Equipment Guidelist Standard for planning, 
design, and construction of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that lists assigned 
room contents (medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures) to each room in PG-18-9. PG18-5
follows PG-18-9’s chapter organization and nomenclature. 
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Program Guide for the Space Planning Criteria 
Standard use to develop space planning guidance for the planning, design, and construction 
of VA healthcare facilities; a Program Guide (PG) that provides space planning guidance for 
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PG-18-9 is 
organized by chapters, as of September 2021 there are 56 clinical and non-clinical PG-18-9 
chapters; they are implemented and deployed in SEPS so that space planners working on VA 
healthcare projects can develop baseline space programs. 
PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs’ Design Guide Standard for planning, design 
and construction of VA healthcare facilities, a Program Guide (PG) that provides design 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Bases Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). 
The narrative section details functional requirements and the Room Template section 
details the planning and design of key rooms in PG-18-9. Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a 
corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide can cover more than one PG-18-9 
chapter. 
Room Area: The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to take place 
in a room / space. It takes into account the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF). 
Room Code (RC): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-18-9 
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space Table 
for VA projects. 
Room Criteria Statement (RCS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each room 
/ space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
420 – Childcare Development Center 
4 of 12 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project. 
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions. 
SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section. 
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM. 
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room. 
VA Technical Information Library (TIL): A resource website maintained by the Facilities 
Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) containing 
a broad range of technical publications related to the planning, design, leasing, and 
construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/ 
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality. 
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
A. Space Planning parameters and metrics in this document are based on the Childcare / 
Development Center Space Planning Criteria Matrix (SPCM) developed as a basis for this 
chapter. The SPCM lists all the spaces a VA Childcare / Development Center site would 
require; the quantity and NSF for each room is calculated based on number of: 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  March 1, 2022 
420 – Childcare Development Center 
5 of 12 
1. Infants (6 to 26 weeks) projected, 
2. Pre-Toddlers (6 to 18 months old) projected, 
3. Toddlers (18 months to 3 years old) projected, 
4. Preschoolers (3 to 5 years old) projected, and 
5. School age children (6 to 10 years old) projected 
The SPCM includes 9 ranges of 25 children incrementally each. 
B. The room quantity (Q) and area (NSF) values included for each range in the SPCM are 
reflected in the Room Criteria Statements, placed immediately below each room name, 
room code and NSF/NSM, for each room in Section 5 of this document. The number of 
children per each category is included in the Input Data Statements (IDSs) in Section 4. 
Both Sections are implemented in the Space Planning and Equipment System (SEPS) 
software accessible through the MAX.gov website. Planners programming a VA 
Childcare / Development Center project shall develop a baseline Program for Design 
(PFD) in SEPS. 
C. SEPS incorporates a Net-to-Department Gross (NTDG) factor of 1.20 for Childcare / 
Development Center and a Building Gross (BG) factor of 1.35 in the space calculation. 
These factors generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building 
Gross Square Feet (BGSF) for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square 
Feet (NSF) for all Departments included. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the 
NTDG factor is fixed. 
D. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website.

collaboration with the following VA internal organizations: Veterans Child Care Assistance 
Program Office (VCAP), Office of Healthcare Environment and Facilities Programs (HEFP), 
Office of Capital Asset Management (OCAM), Office of Security and Law Enforcement 
(OSLE), Office of Healthcare Engineering (19HEFE) / Physical Security and Resiliency Design 
Manual (PSRDM), National Infectious Diseases Service (NIDS), and the Office of Construction 
and Facilities Management (CFM).
2 DEFINITIONS 
VA Kids Care: A drop-in play area where a contractor provides short-term childcare services 
while Veterans attend qualified VA medical appointments. Drop-in/short-term childcare 
services will be limited to three hours per child per day which will eliminate classification as 
a full-time day care center.
Space Planning / SEPS
Building Gross (BG) Factor: A Factor applied to the sum of all the Departmental Gross 
Square Footage (DGSF) in a project to determine the Building Gross Square Footage. This 
factor accounts for square footage used by the building envelope, structural systems, 
horizontal and vertical circulation including main corridors, elevators, stairs and escalators, 
shafts, and mechanical spaces. The Department of Veterans Affairs has set this factor at 
1.35 and included guidance in case of variance when developing a Program for Design (PFD) 
in SEPS.
Department Net to Gross (DNTG) Factor: A parameter, determined by the VA for each 
clinical and non-clinical department PG-18-9 space planning criteria chapter, used to 
convert the programmed Net Square Feet (NSF) area to the Department Gross Square Feet 
(DGSF) area.
Functional Area (FA): The grouping of rooms and spaces based on their function within a 
clinical service or department.
Input Data Statement(s) (IDSs): A question or set of questions designed to elicit information 
about the healthcare project to generate a Program for Design (PFD) based on the 
parameters set forth in this set of documents. This information is processed through 
mathematical and logical operations in the VA Space and Equipment Planning System 
(SEPS).
JSN (Joint Schedule Number): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each content 
item in the PG-18-5 Standard. JSNs are defined in DoD’s Military Standard 1691 and 
included in SEPS Content Table.
Net Square Feet / Net Square Meters (NSF/NSM): The area of a room or space derived from 
that within the interior surface of the bounding walls or boundaries.

PG-18-12: A Department of Veterans Affairs Design Program Guide (PG) standard for VA 
healthcare facilities, it provides design guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and 
Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs), and Veteran Centers. This PG is commonly 
referred to as the Design Guide and provides a narrative section dealing with the facility 
design requirements, and a graphic section, the Room Template, for key rooms in PG-18-9. 
Not all PG-18-9 chapters have a corresponding PG-18-12 Design Guide; one Design Guide 
can cover more than one PG-18-9 chapter.
PG-18-5: A Department of Veterans Affairs Equipment Planning Program Guide (PG) 
standard for VA healthcare facilities, also referred as Equipment Guidelist. It lists assigned 
room contents: medical equipment, furniture, and fixtures for the corresponding PG-18-9 
Chapter, it follows the Functional Area and Room Name and Room Code nomenclature.
PG-18-9: A Department of Veterans Affairs Space Planning Program Guide (PG) standard for 
VA healthcare facilities, also referred as the Space Planning Criteria Chapter It provides 
guidance for VA Medical Centers (VAMCs), Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs), 
and Veteran Centers. PG-18-9 is organized by chapters, as of July 2025 there are 54 Patient 
Care and Patient Care Support   chapters; they are implemented, deployed, and accessible 
in the SEPS software.
Program for Design (PFD): A project specific itemized listing of the spaces, rooms, and 
square foot area required for the proper operation of a specific service / department, and 
the corresponding area for each. PFDs are generated by SEPS based on the PG-18-9 
Standard and are referred as the Baseline Program for Design for the Project.
Project Room Contents (PRC): The list of equipment for every room in the project as defined 
in PG-18-5.
Room Area (RM NSF): The square footage required for a clinical or non-clinical function to 
take place in a room / space. It considers the floor area required by equipment (medical and 
non-medical), furniture, circulation, and appropriate function / code-mandated clearances. 
Room area is measured in Net Square Feet (NSF).
Room Code (RM CD): A unique five alpha-numeric code assigned to each room in the PG-189
Standard. Room Codes in PG-18-9 are unique to VA and are the basis for SEPS’s Space 
Table for VA projects.
Room Count: Number of rooms, all types, generated by SEPS correlated to the userprovided
information requested in the Input Data Statements (IDSs) of a Department. Total 
Room Count and NSF by FA is provided in the Program for Desing (PFD) project Report.
Room Criteria Statement (RM CS): A mathematical / logical formulation assigned to each 
room / space included in PG-18-9 incorporating answers to Input Data Statements (IDSs) to 
determine the provision of the room / space in the baseline space program or Program for 
Design (PFD) for a project.

SEPS Importer: A style-based format developed to allow upload of RCSs and IDSs to SEPS to 
implement and operationalize space planning criteria in PG-18-9 in the SEPS digital tool. 
This format establishes the syntax used in the RCSs and allows the use of Shortcuts. 
Shortcuts allow developers of space planning criteria statements to simplify RCSs making 
full use of their logical and mathematical functionality. A shortcut can refer to an RCS, a 
room in any FA or a formula. Shortcuts are [bracketed] when used in FAs and RCSs and are 
listed along with their equivalences at the end of the Space Planning Criteria section.
SEPS: Acronym for Space and Equipment Planning System which produces equipment lists 
and Program for Design for a healthcare project based on specific information entered in 
response to Input Data Questions.
Space Planning Concept Matrix (SPCM): A working document developed during the chapter 
update process. It lists all the rooms organized by Functional Area and establishes ratios 
between the directly and the indirectly workload driven rooms for the planning range 
defined in this document. The matrix is organized in ascending workload values in ranges 
reflecting existing facilities and potential future increase. Section 5 of this document Space 
Planning Criteria reflects the values in the SPCM.
VA Room Family (VA RF): An organizational system of rooms / spaces grouped by function, a 
‘Room Family’. There are two “Orders” in the VA RF: Patient Care and Patient Care Support; 
Patient Care features four sub-orders: Clinical, Inpatient, Outpatient and Residential Clinical. 
There are also four sub-orders in the Patient Care Support order: Building Support, Clinical 
Support, Staff Support and Veteran Support. Each room in a Family has a unique Room Code 
and NSF assigned based on its Room Contents and function which correspond to the specific 
use of the room. The same RC can be assigned to different Room Names with the same 
function in this document and can be assigned an NSF that varies based on the PG-18-5 
Room Contents assigned to the room.
VA Technical Information Library Management System (TIL-MS): A resource website 
maintained by the Facilities Standards Service (FSS) Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) containing a broad range of technical publications related to the 
planning, design, leasing, and construction of VA facilities. VA-TIL can be accessed at: 
https://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/
VA-SEPS: SEPS Module where the VA’s PG-18-9 chapters are uploaded. There is a 
corresponding Module for MHS space planning criteria chapters. Planners working on 
projects on SEPS have access to both sets of space criteria to generate Agency specific 
Space Planning Criteria PFDs. Additionally, access to Space Table definitions to both VA and 
MHS to allow them to use as needed during the SEPS project development.
Workload: Workload is the anticipated number of procedures, clinic stops, clinic encounters 
etc. that is processed through a department/service area. The total workload applied to 
departmental operational assumptions will determine overall room requirements by 
modality.
3 OPERATING RATIONALE AND BASIS OF CRITERIA 
PG-18-9 – SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA  August 1, 2025
421 – DROP-IN CHILDCARE CENTER
5 of 10
A. The space planning and design Program Guides: PG-18-9, PG-18-5, and PG-18-12 are 
available at the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management (CFM) Technical Information Library (TIL) website.
B. The utilization levels of a drop-in childcare space are expected to align with those of the 
Medical Center, where peak utilization occurs between 9:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. 
Utilization during this time might reach a maximum occupancy level of 15 children. 
Typical operational occupancy levels are anticipated to be five to six children, with an 
overall average of 23 children over an eight-hour period. deviations above these levels 
will require consultation with OHE and VCAP for additional criteria. This would allow 
care for approximately 6,000 children yearly. Normal operations are expected to be 7:30 
a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, with flexibility to align with the facility’s 
extended outpatient appointment schedule. Drop-in childcare services typically begin 30 
minutes before the first appointment and end 30 minutes after the end of the last 
appointment each day.
C. Anticipated utilization rates align with a maximum occupancy level of 17 based on the 
typical state maximum occupancy levels. These levels vary from state to state and are 
generally consistent at 35 square feet per child in play areas. Maximum occupancy levels 
should be set at each facility based on its respective state codes.
D. This also aligns with maximum occupancy levels based on the National Fire Protection 
Association (NFPA) Life Safety Code (NFPA 101).
E. There are no variations for individual space requirements based on the children’s ages. 
Regardless of age, all children will be monitored within one large open area due to the 
short duration of stay and high turn-over rate within the daily operating hours. The 
average length of stay for a VA Kids Care childcare encounter is projected to be 60-90 
minutes.
F. SEPS incorporates a Net‐to‐Department Gross (NTDG) factor of 1.20 for Drop-In 
Childcare Center and a Building Gross (BG) factor of 1.35 in the space calculation. These 
factors generate the Department Gross Square Feet (DGSF) and the Building Gross 
Square Feet (BGSF) for the project based on the aggregate resulting Net Square Feet 
(NSF) for all Departments included. Planners can adjust the BGSF factor in SEPS; the 
NTDG factor is fixed.
